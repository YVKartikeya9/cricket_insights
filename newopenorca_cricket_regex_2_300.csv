"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.","An eight-year-old boy has left doctors baffled after his hands swelled to giant proportions and now weigh more than two stone. Young Kaleem, from India, is unable to carry out simple tasks, including tying his own shoe laces, after he was born with hands twice the size of an average baby. His mother Haleema, 27, said she knew he was different at birth but was powerless to help and the youngster's hands have now grown so large they measure 13 inches from the base of his palm to the end of his middle finger. Scroll down for video. Kaleem, from India, was born with hands twice the size of an average baby and they have continued to grow. His hands now measure 13 inches from the base of his palm to the tip of his middle finger and weigh two stone. The eight-year-old claims he is bullied because of his giant hands and has difficulty performing simple tasks. The cricket fan said he has been bullied and shunned most of his life because others are 'scared' of his deformity. He said: 'I do not go to school because the teacher says other kids are scared of my hands. 'Many of them used to bully me for my deformity. They would say ""let's beat up the kid with the large hands"". 'Some of them have actually beaten me and would go after me often. 'I find it difficult to put on my clothes, button my shirt and pull up my pants. 'But I don't know if I want doctors to operate on my hands. They would have to make me unconscious and then they would cut me open. 'I have no problem if they could do it without an injection. A small operation would be okay.' His parents, who earn just £15 a month, have been desperately trying to find help for their son - but to no avail. His mother Haleema, 27, (pictured with Kaleem and another one of her children) said she feels 'powerless' Kaleem, a keen cricketer, said the teachers at his school have told him other children are 'scared' of his hands. He has found it difficulty to play cricket and hold a bat due to his condition but tries to still join in with his friends. His mother, who has other children who do not suffer from the same condition, said: 'When Kaleem was born his hand was twice the size of a normal baby's. 'His hands were big and his fingers were long. Initially his fists were small but they began to grow large as well and his fingers also kept growing.' His father, Shamim, 45, who works as a labourer, is worried his son will never be independent and blames himself for not earning enough money. 'He has difficulty feeding himself because his fist does not bend properly - so we have to feed him,' he said. 'Using two fingers he is able to pick up some things like a glass of water to drink. 'We want to take him to the hospital but there have been times when money has been so low that my wife has been forced to go begging. 'In that kind of financial situation, getting treatment for Kaleem was difficult. 'Even when I tried to get Kaleem into the school, the headmaster told me to put in writing that the school would not be responsible if the other children were afraid of his hands or bullied him or laughed at him.' Doctors in India have been left baffled by his growing hands and many are at a loss as to what the condition is. The youngster has difficulty eating, tying his shoelaces and carrying out other basic tasks due to his  hands. Kaleem's father Shamim, 45, (pictured together above) is worried his son will never become independent. The couple have only just been able to take their son to a local doctor for an assessment but their hopes of an instant cure have been dashed. Dr Ratan, the director of the local hospital, said: 'As far as my knowledge goes, this is an extremely rare condition. 'I have not seen a case in medical journals or on the internet where only the hands grew to such a large size. 'Until we have done proper genetic testing we will not be able to say exactly what is causing this deformity.' He said that apart from the unsightly growths, Kaleem is in good health - with properly functioning lungs and heart. Doctors have assessed Kaleem and have described his hands as a 'rare condition'. He is otherwise healthy. Kaleem was born with larger-than-average hands but they have continued to grow throughout his childhood. But as his hands continue to grow it may put increased pressure on his cardiovascular system, potentially shortening his life. Elsewhere, Dr Krishan Chugh, head of paediatrics at the state-of-the-art Fortis Memorial Research Institute in Gurgaon, near Delhi, has also been left baffled after reviewing photographs and videos of the boy's hands. However, he believes Kaleem may be suffering from either lymphangioma or hamartoma - which are both treatable. He added: 'This condition looks very rare and I have come across something like this before. Without proper examination and medical tests I am not 100 per cent sure about what this is.' Kaleem's parents are now hoping to raise money for their son in the hope that his condition can be treated. One doctor said he believes the Kaleem may be suffering from either lymphangioma - a condition of the lymphatic system causing extreme inflamation - or hamartoma - a benign tumour - both of which are treatable. Lymphangioma is a condition of the lymphatic system which causes extreme inflammation resulting in doughy masses forming in certain parts of the body. Hamartoma is a benign type of tumour where the body produces excess tissue. After hearing from the doctors, Kaleem's parents now have renewed optimism that something can be done for their son and are doubling their efforts to raise money for him. 'We have tried several places with no solutions so far,' said Shamim. 'But I have a feeling there is a way to get the resources to give my son a normal life.'

 oversized scarf on top. The different textures (the canvas jacket against a softer woolen or knit scarf) will add a fun contrast to your outfit. Let the scarf hang down low. Or try tying the scarf in different patterns. Try switching up your military jacket style by pairing it with a thick belt worn at your true waist. This will break up the traditional form of the military jacket and give it a fun new style! Use a belt in a complementary color like hunter green, light brown, or even orange. Try pairing your military jacket with heels or other dress shoes to class it up a bit. Under the military jacket, you can pair dressier shoes with jeans, slacks, or even tights and a cute dress. This is also a fun way to turn your daytime jacket look into a nighttime jacket look. Adding heels (or, for men, nice dress shoes) adds a more formal flare/style. Try carrying a more petite handbag with your military jacket outfit. This will add a nice contrast to the larger size of your bulky military jacket. Try a small handbag with a long chain shoulder strap or a dainty little bowler bag with no over-the-shoulder straps, just handles. Avoid large cross-body bags, as the military jacket is already relatively bulky. Hats are a great way to spice up any outfit. If you want to dress your military jacket down, try wearing a beanie hat for a casual, more relaxed look. If you want to class it up a bit, wear a fedora hat with the outfit. You can even wear a panama hat to add some edgy contrast to the outfit. Try playing on the military tradition a bit by adding your own funky version of military stripes. Add some cute and exciting pins to the breast of your military jacket, or down the sleeve, to give it a little something extra. Add colorful pins that really draw attention to the design.

Movie plot title: Meet the Robinsons Movie plot: Lewis is an aspiring 12-year-old inventor at an orphanage whose inventions have been scaring off potential parents. He decides that his mother, who abandoned him at the orphanage as an infant, is the only one who ever truly loved him and works on a machine to scan his memory to locate her. Taking his memory scanner to his school's science fair, Lewis meets 13-year-old Wilbur Robinson, a mysterious boy claiming to be a time cop from the future. Wilbur needs to recover a time machine that a man wearing a bowler hat has stolen. Lewis tries to demonstrate the scanner, but it falls apart, throwing the science fair into chaos. Upset, Lewis leaves while the Bowler Hat Guy, with the help of a robotic bowler hat named Doris, repairs and steals the scanner. Wilbur meets Lewis at the orphanage and asks him to repair the scanner. Lewis agrees to do so only if Wilbur can prove he is telling the truth, which Wilbur does by taking them to the year 2037 in a second time machine. When they arrive, however, Lewis says he can use the time machine instead of the scanner, and he and Wilbur get into an argument and crash. Wilbur then asks Lewis to fix the time machine, but Lewis has another condition: Wilbur has to take him to visit his mother afterwards. Reluctantly, Wilbur agrees and hides Lewis in the garage. Lewis doesn't stay there for long, however, and ends up meeting the rest of the Robinsons except for Cornelius, Wilbur's father, who is away on a business trip. Following Lewis, the Bowler Hat Guy and Doris unsuccessfully try to kidnap him. Meanwhile, the Robinsons offer to adopt Lewis, but change their mind when they learn that he's from the past.

Sri Lankan player Thilan Samaraweera is taken aboard an ambulance Wednesday in Colombo. Police in Lahore on Wednesday confirmed six police officers and a driver of a van carrying umpires were killed after earlier reports had put the death toll at eight. Six team members were wounded by glass and shrapnel, and two -- Tharanga Paranavitana and Thilan Samaraweera -- were shot in the chest and leg, respectively. Both men were being treated in Colombo and in stable condition, officials said. ""We are very lucky that no one [sustained] any serious injuries and everyone is in good shape,"" one player told reporters upon arriving in the capital. ""There are a few more guys who need more time to recover. And we can hopefully put this behind us and move forward."" The attack happened Tuesday at about 9 a.m. (11 p.m. ET Monday), as the visiting Sri Lankan team's bus approached Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium for a match against Pakistan.  See a map of where the attack took place ». The brazen daylight attack sent shock waves across the cricket-crazy region and raised fears about the future of world cricket matches in Pakistan, which has been reeling from a string of terrorist attacks. iReport: Send us your videos, photos. ""The events can only be described as shocking, and we send our sympathy to the relatives of those who lost their lives,"" International Cricket Council President David Morgan said at a news conference in London Tuesday. ""On many occasions we've been told that cricketers would never be targeted in Pakistan. And this morning's events have proved that to be quite incorrect.""  Watch ICC's reaction to the attack ». ICC Chief Executive Haroon Lorgat said none of the teams had been threatened before Tuesday's attack, which happened about 150 meters from the stadium in Lahore. Investigators cannot yet say who was responsible for the ambush.  Watch footage of the gunmen staging their attack ». Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari praised Pakistani police, saying the officers ""rose to the occasion and laid down their lives to protect our Sri Lankan guests."" He also telephoned Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa to express his condemnation and regrets, and to emphasize his determination to investigate.  Watch Sri Lankan's foreign minister condemnation of the attack ». Teams have long stayed away from Pakistan, concerned about the security situation in a country that is battling an escalating pro-Taliban insurgency. But Sri Lanka -- a country enduring its own civil war with separatist rebels -- agreed in December to visit for a series of matches, after the Indian cricket team called off its tour following the deadly terror attacks in Mumbai in November. Indian authorities blamed those attacks on Pakistan-based militants. The Pakistan Cricket Board had said it was set to lose more than $16 million as a result of India's cancellation, but the Sri Lanka visit was to help it recoup most of the costs, officials said. The Sri Lankan offer to tour was a reciprocal gesture. Pakistan was one of two countries that agreed to tour Sri Lanka during the 1996 World Cup tournament, while other countries refused to travel there because of security concerns. With this attack, fans now worry that Pakistan won't be able to co-host the 2011 Cricket World Cup with India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Morgan said the ICC's board will be meeting in April to consider whether the Cup will include stops in Pakistan. ""The board will have to think very carefully about the extent to which Pakistan will be used for that event,"" Morgan said. ""It's a very important event, but the safety and security of players, officials and supporters is very important and the board will be taking that into account.""  Read profiles of the wounded players ». ""This has really damaged Pakistan,"" former Pakistani cricket player Zahir Abbas told Geo-TV. ""Already some teams didn't want to come to Pakistan. Now who will come after this incident?"" John Stern, the editor of cricket magazine Wisden, said it was ""not possible"" to imagine international cricket taking place in Pakistan in the near future. He described the situation for the sport in the country as ""desperate.""  Watch how attack strikes at legitimacy of Pakistani government ».

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.,"A game called hockey was played in English public schools in the early 19th century. Lord Lytton wrote in 1853 that On the common some young men were playing at hockey. That old-fashioned game, now very uncommon in England, except at schools ... Hockey's popularity increased with that of other team games. A version of the game played in south-east London was rougher than the modern version, played on a very large field (247m by 64m), and used a cube of black rubber and rough planed sticks. The modern game was developed on the other side of London by Middlesex cricket clubs, especially Teddington Hockey Club. The members of these clubs were looking for winter exercise, but did not particularly care for football. In 1870, members of the Teddington cricket club, who had recently moved to play in Bushy Park, were looking for a winter activity. They experimented with a' stick' game, based loosely on the rules of association football. Teddington played the game on the smooth outfield of their cricket pitch and used a cricket ball, so allowing smooth and predictable motion. By 1874 they had begun to draw up rules for their game, including banning the raising of the stick above shoulder height and stipulating that a shot at goal must take place within the circle in front of it. An association was formed in 1875, which dissolved after seven years, but in 1886 the Hockey Association was formed by seven London clubs and representatives from Trinity College, Cambridge. Blackheath were one of the founder members, but refused to accept the rules drawn up by the other clubs and left to found the National Hockey Union. The Union failed, but the Association grew rapidly.

The passengers cram into a small village hotel for the night. Among the hotel guests eager to return to England are two British gentlemen, Caldicott and Charters, who are worried about missing the upcoming cricket Test match. The only room left for them is the maid's room. Other Britons are Iris (Margaret Lockwood), a young woman of independent means who has spent a holiday with some friends, now returning home to be married, Miss Froy (May Whitty), an elderly lady who has worked some years abroad as a governess and music teacher, Gilbert (Michael Redgrave), a young musicologist who has been studying the folk songs of the region, and a secretive couple Mr. and Mrs. Todhunter (Cecil Parker and Linden Travers) who are having a clandestine affair. Folk dancers stomp loudly in Gilbert's room just above Iris, making it impossible for Miss Froy to properly hear a musician singing a haunting melody out in the street. Iris bribes the manager to throw Gilbert out of his room. Gilbert retaliates by barging into Iris's room and refusing to leave. Miss Froy seems to particularly enjoy the musician in the street below, and she throws a coin out her window. The music stops, as a murderous hand is seen to strangle the balladeer, but no one seems to notice anything wrong.The next morning, as the passengers are leaving the hotel to board the train, Miss Froy asks Iris for help in finding her luggage. They huddle around a pile of baggage, and just then a flowerpot is pushed off a window ledge from an upper floor. The pot appears meant for Miss Froy, but it knocks Iris on the head, instead. She says she is all right and gets on the train, but drops unconscious once aboard. When she recovers, she finds herself seated in a compartment across from Miss Froy, who has evidently helped her. In the compartment are other passengers who appear not to understand English.Iris and Miss...

Originally a top-order batsman, his developing medium pace bowling has made him an all-rounder and he has the best bowling figures for England in a Twenty20 International. Bopara has also played for Karachi Kings in the Pakistan Super League, Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier League, Sydney Sixers in the Big Bash League and Chittagong Vikings in the Bangladesh Premier League. Bopara was first called up to the England One Day International team in 2007, before a difficult Test debut in Sri Lanka saw him dropped in early 2008 after a string of three ducks.

 not batting in the first game and then making just 27 runs in the next two games combined. On 30 August, in the fourth match of huge series, he featured in a prominent tail end partnership, this time with Stuart Broad as the pair added an unbeaten 99 for the 8th wicket to defeat India at Old Trafford. Bopara finished 43 not out. He could not continue his good form, making just 11 in the next match.  He made his Test debut in the tour to Sri Lanka in December 2007 but had a poor series, scoring only 42 runs in five innings including three ducks, and taking only one wicket at an average of 81. One BBC commentator described him as ""well out of his depth at Test level"", and Bopara was subsequently selected in the ODI squad but not the Test squad for the tour to New Zealand in early 2008. However, he returned to the Test squad for the fourth Test against South Africa in August 2008, following a good season for Essex in the County Championship.  On 4 June 2008, Bopara recorded his highest List A score in the quarter finals of the Friends Provident Trophy. He scored an unbeaten 201 runs off 138 balls, including 18 fours and 10 sixes. Bopara's score was just the eighth instance of a double hundred in the history of List A cricket and the highest for six years. On 9 September 2008 Bopara was named in England's 15-man squad for the inaugural Stanford Super Series in Antigua. There, England took on the Middlesex Crusaders and Trinidad and Tobago before facing the Stanford All-Stars on 1 November. The winning players in that match would have earned $1million each, with a further $1million being shared between the four players left out of the side. This never came to fruition, however, as England fell to a heavy defeat in the final. The same day, Bopara was also handed an Increment Contract by the ECB.

The Dr. Gridlock column receives hundreds of letters each month from motorists and transit riders throughout the Washington region. They ask questions and make complaints about getting around a region plagued with some of the worst traffic in the nation. The doctor diagnoses problems and tries to bring relief.

 Washington, D.C. 20071.

 it's a pleasure to join you on what's shaping up as an interesting day in local transportation.

 where the transit authority was displaying some new rail car interiors. One was a test car that has some bench seating along the sides. Metro wants to put that on the rails today or tomorrow and see how you react to it.

 away from the congestion around the doors that riders find so annoying. I'll put something up on our Get There blog later today, describing this some more. Maybe I can show you a picture, too.

 at about the time we wrap up this discussion at 2 p.m., a panel of experts commissioned by the state of Virginia will be releasing its recommendations on whether the new rail line through Tyson's Corner should be above or below ground.

 or anything else in transit and traffic that's on your mind today. I can tell you some of the things I've been up to during my first week as the new Dr. Gridlock.

Let's start off with some of the questions and comments that were waiting for me when I came in.

 D.C.: Why Dr. Gridlock? Did you write a dissertation? Get an honorary degree?

 I think you should go by Mr. Gridlock.

 trying to learn about what hurts, so I can make proper diagnoses. For example, I circumnavigated the outer loop of the Capital Beltway.

 Yellow and Blue lines to complete.

 Fairfax Parkway, Route 7, the Ride On bus, the DC Circulator -- I know it's Cole's Notes, not ""Grey's Anatomy."" I know you expect the doc to know our corner of the world on a micro level.

 Md.: Congratulations (I think) for becoming the next Dr. Gridlock!

 but it seems like summer commuting is a good indication of what rush hour traffic would be like if more people telecommuted. Just taking off the vacationers from the roads during the summer seems to make a tough commute tolerable.

Dr. Gridlock: One thing I'm very aware of as I go out on test drives across the region is that I'm not seeing experiencing the agonies that so many of you have reported for so long. We've had a lot of people respond to our Get There posting by offering to let us accompany them on their commutes. I expect to be doing that.

 I've had a luxurious commute: Red Line from Silver Spring to Farragut North. I used to drive downtown, but it dawned on me that I was paying ten bucks a day to warehouse my car. When I started taking the Red Line, I figured I was saving about $750 a year. Must have been a lot more by the time I stopped doing that regularly.

 but I am sure you are going to do great. Any word on when the Springfield Interchange will finally be completed? There were MAJOR backups this weekend coming from Washington, D.C. going south.

 I do indeed feel like I have big shoes to fill, and I'm trying to get smart in a hurry. I've been The Post's editor for local transportation issues for most of the past seven years, so I've got a broad understanding of the region's traffic and transit issues. Now, I'm trying to learn this at the level you folks expect.

 the Wilson Bridge, also is on schedule. Second span is to be completed in 2008.

 as they progress. There's a lot of work going on at Springfield that has a high impact on travelers. Wilson Bridge opened the first new span over the past two months. That was a big disruption on two weekends as the lanes were shifted to the new span, but I thought it was managed very well.

 Md.: What is your view of the Purple Line's chances of becoming a reality (in our lifetime)?

 I used to ask the reporters to write a series called ""Not In My Lifetime,"" describing all the road and rail projects that we've been teased about over the years.

 I'm wondering if the Purple Line and Rail to Dulles will fall into this category. Both projects have serious financing issues. Both have issues about whether to tunnel. There are questions about whether the federal government will provide essential funding.

These are issues on want to stay on top of in the newspaper column and online.

 Md.: Dr. Dr. Give me the news, I've got a bad case of gridlock blues.

Wondering if there has been any further news on the Metro expansion to BWI and all those stops along the way?

Dr. Gridlock: I just expressed my concerns about the Purple Line and Rail to Dulles. That goes triple for Metro to BWI. It's another project that would require gobs of federal money. How could Maryland suck up that much more money from the feds after the inter county connector and the Purple Line?

 Va.: What type of vehicle do you drive?? Other car and trucks in the family. I really think Dr. Gridlock should have a Ducati 999 in Ferrari Red.!

 Steven Ginsberg, says I need to buy a hybrid -- that Dr. Gridlock needs to make a statement. Others say a hybrid, with a GPS, and satellite radio.

 who commutes from our inside the Beltway home in Montgomery County home to Baltimore, gets first crack at vehicles. When she builds up high mileage, she passes them down to me.

 Md.: I figure that the high heat that is predicted for the next few days will require the trains to slow down, due to the tracks' tendency to expand with heat.

 when the temperature causes the freight lines that own some of the region's track to issue go-slow orders to the commuter lines. Seems like there have been an awful lot of them this summer. It must be hard to operate a commuter service when riders can't count on a schedule.

I understand the safety issue involved: That high heat can kink rails and create dangerous situations.

 I'm an admirer of Train Talk, the alert system used by VRE to keep riders informed of such things.

 D.C.: I'm curious. I know you've subbed in from Mr. Ginsberg on his blog when he's away. Do you plan to have your own Dr. Gridlock blog or do you plan to share with him?

 our plan is to share the Get There blog. Steven was on vacation last week. (He looks great. Tanned and rested for his new assignment.)

ICC in my backyard: Speaking of the ICC - do you think it will be built? How do you feel about it since you live in Silver Spring?

Dr. Gridlock: It's always been an interesting thing to me: The projects that soak up most of our transportation money don't necessarily have a widespread impact.

 ICC is in that category. We live in Silver Spring. If we want to go over to Bethesda, we take either East-West Highway or the Beltway. If we're going to Baltimore, it's Route 29 or I-95, and maybe sometimes the BW Parkway. I don't expect I'll drive the ICC, though it will be just a few miles from where I live.

 Md: Got to go .Will I be able to see responses later, and where?

Dr. Gridlock: We'll have a transcript posted. That's true of all our Live Onlines.

 you know -- like sidewalks closed for construction, and drivers who won't yield.

Dr. Gridlock: We get many such comments and indeed will be certain to pay attention to issues concerning biking and walking.

 D.C.: Why was the new Wilson Bridge span designed with the same number of lanes as the old Wilson Bridge span? Size matters. What's up with that?

 there will be more lanes on the bridge than on the Beltway approaches to it.

 the advantage is that at least the new span has shoulders for disabled vehicles.

 the relief is sporadic. Last summer (when I started this commute), I remember lighter traffic more days than not. Is anyone else noticing this?

 too. I think summer traffic is generally down, but there are exceptions.

 Md.: I read about how starting this fall all the trains on the Red Line will go to the end of the line during the weekend and non-peak hours. How about peak hours? It would be great if all the trains went to Shady Grove.

 trains will no longer turn back at Grosvenor during non-peak hours and on weekends. Maryland had to pay for the additional service.

 as opposed to the east side where trains turn back at Silver Spring, is the extra development to the west that's increasing rider ship on the Shady Grove side.

 you know -- like sidewalks closed for construction, and drivers who won't yield."": Can I ask that the analysis of the issue present the problem from both sides? LOTS of pedestrians downtown think that the ""Don't Walk"" signs don't apply to them. They walk when it starts flashing and become livid if drivers don't yield--well, if it says ""Don't Walk,"" the driver isn't supposed to have to yield (the pedestrian is!) None of us will ever get anywhere if BOTH sides don't cooperate.

 but no New Yorker is stupid enough to try to hold up oncoming cars (especially not taxis). D.C. pedestrians need the same common sense!

 I encounter one that seems to skip about 10 seconds. That makes it extra interesting.

 what can you do? Congrats on the new position and thanks for taking the time to get to know us!

 too.

 where transportation researcher Diane Mattingly is based, I look at the online traffic cameras before I leave home and before I leave the bureau -- not that there are all that many alternatives anyway.

 but I have two questions. First, the obvious, are they planning any more routes? Second, do they have any plans to better advertise and encourage riders to purchase tickets before boarding and then to enter by any door? It seems as though no one knows they can do this! I only know that you can by going to their Web site. It is a great system similar to London's bendy-buses, and it really speeds things up if the bus doesn't have to wait for a long queue to put their exact change into the fare box. I also wish they would put a SmartTrip scanner near the rear door so that those users can bypass the front and enter the rear. Thanks.

 and I might write about it for the Sunday Gridlock column.

 they could still do more. I like your suggestion about the SmartTrip cards at the other doors, but bet that's an expensive addition. The service is pretty heavily subsidized already.

 or taking a trip you don't usually take -- it's a bit hard to figure out your best stop from inside the bus.

 Va.: Can you please explain why anyone continues to drive inside the Beltway? I'm from the Midwest, where I've been driving since the age of 15, and since moving to the area I love the freedom of public transportation. With the D.C. Metro trip planner web site you can easily get anywhere in the Beltway. My friends tease me for this fondness of buses and metro, but I catch up on my reading, rest, and even nap while they sit in traffic polluting our environment. On top of that, I've met many interesting people and learned a lot about the region in just a few years here.

 but I do drive. For example, if my wife and I want to go to dinner in Bethesda some night, we're not going to take the Red Line V into downtown Washington and then back up to Bethesda. The bus connections would be problematic. Purple Line would make a difference.

 Md.: I think it would be good for you to let readers know your positions on some of our regional transportation issues such as the Tyson's to Dulles Rail Project, the Bethesda to New Carrollton ""Purple Line,"" adding HOT lanes to the VA Beltway, the ICC, etc.

 for example.

 and hope to restart the Dr. Gridlock columns in The Post's Extra sections in late August.

 Exit 1: Good afternoon and congratulations on becoming Dr. Gridlock. I imagine it's like being the next Dr. Who, you travel around and try to solve problems.

 or is success more a measure of the number of readers who informally exchange alternate routes, but mainly vent about bad traffic management and driving practices?

Thank you and best wishes.

 too.

 though, you readers of the columns and the blogs and the Live Onlines help each other. I've seen you do that over the years through Dr. Gridlock.

 despite having many, many more questions and comments to go, I think I'd better sign off for today. I want to get up a blog item about those new Metro rail cars and maybe post a picture of the interior.

 please be aware that I'm reading them all and will take the advice seriously and try to find answers to the questions, so that I can respond in future discussions and columns.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Many independent Chicago-based record labels were also getting their artists on the dance charts. Detroit DJ Terrence Parker uses his advanced turntablism skills and his focus on precision to blend hip hop music DJing styles, such as rhythmic scratching, in his house mixes. Fellow Detroit spinner DJ Minx is a notable woman house DJ. Her records on her Women on Wax label blend Parker-influenced turntablism precision with a funky style. In the UK, any house song released by a Chicago-based label was routinely considered a ""must-play"" at UK house music clubs. Paradise Garage in New York City was still a top club in the house era, just as it had been during the disco age. The emergence of Todd Terry, a pioneer of the genre, demonstrated the continuum from the underground disco approach which moved to a new house sound. Terry's cover of Class Action's ""Weekend"" (mixed by Larry Levan) shows how Terry drew on newer hip-hop influences, such as the quicker sampling and the more rugged basslines. In the late 1980s, Nu Groove Records launched and nurtured the careers of Rheji Burrell and Rhano Burrell, collectively known as Burrell (after a brief stay on Virgin America via Timmy Regisford and Frank Mendez). Nu Groove also had a stable of other NYC underground scene DJs. The Burrell's created the ""New York Underground"" sound of house, and they did 30+ releases on this label featuring this sound. In the 2010s, Nu Groove Record releases like the Burrells' enjoy a cult status among ""crate diggers"" and DJs. Mint-condition vinyl records by the Burrells from the 1980s can fetch high prices. By the late 1980s, house DJing and production had moved to the US's west coast, particularly to San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles, Fresno, San Diego and Seattle. Los Angeles saw am explosion of underground raves, where DJs mixed dance tracks. L.A. DJs Marques Wyatt and Billy Long spun at Jewel's Catch One. In 1989, the L.A.-based, former EBN-OZN singer/rapper Robert Ozn started indie house label One Voice Records. Ozn released the Mike...

 AM (; born 14 November 1971), nicknamed ""Gilly"" or ""Churchy"", is a former Australian international cricketer and former captain of all formats. Widely regarded as the greatest wicket-keeper-batsman in the history of the game, Gilchrist held the world record for the most dismissals by a wicket-keeper in One Day International (ODI) cricket until it was surpassed by Kumar Sangakkara in 2015 and the most by an Australian in Test cricket. He was captain of Middlesex in the domestic arena. Gilchrist was selected for the state under-17 team, and in 1989 he was offered a scholarship by London-based Richmond Cricket Club, a scheme he now supports himself.

 that is to agree that they have been dismissed and leave the field of play without waiting for (or contrary to) an umpire's decision. Gilchrist reignited this debate by walking during a high-profile match, the 2003 World Cup semi-final against Sri Lanka, after the umpire ruled him to be not out. He has since proclaimed himself to be ""a walker"", or a batsman who will consistently walk, and has done so on numerous occasions. On one occasion against Bangladesh, Gilchrist walked but TV replays failed to suggest any contact between his bat and the ball. Without such contact, he could not have been caught out.  Gilchrist's actions have sparked debate amongst current and former players and umpires. Ricky Ponting has declared on several occasions that he is not a walker but will leave it to each player to decide whether they wish to walk or not. While no other Australian top order batsmen have expressly declared themselves to be walkers, lower-order batsmen Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz both walked during Test matches in India in 2004. In 2004, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming accused Gilchrist of conducting a ""walking crusade"" when Craig McMillan refused to walk after Gilchrist had caught him off an edge from the bowling of Jason Gillespie in the First Test in Brisbane. After the appeal was turned down by the umpire, who did not hear the edge, Gilchrist goaded McMillan about the edge, and McMillan's angry response was picked up by the stump microphone: ""...not everyone is walking, Gilly ... not everyone has to walk, mate..."". The taunt was effective, however, as McMillan, perhaps distracted, missed the next ball and was given out leg before wicket. Gilchrist said in his autobiography that he had ""zero support in the team"" for his stance and that he felt that the topic made the dressing room uncomfortable. He added that he ""felt isolated"" and ""silently accused of betraying the team. Implicitly I was made to feel selfish, as if I was walking for the sake of my own clean image, thereby making everyone else look dishonest.""  Gilchrist has been noted for his emotional outbursts on the cricket field, and has been fined multiple times for dissent against umpiring decisions. In January 2006, he was fined 40% of his match fee in an ODI against South Africa. In another instance, in early 2004 in Sri Lanka, Gilchrist audibly argued with umpire Peter Manuel after batting partner Andrew Symonds was given out. After the argument concluded, Manuel consulted umpiring partner Billy Bowden and reversed his decision, recalling Symonds to the crease. Gilchrist was also reprimanded by the Australian Cricket Board for publicly questioning the legality of Muttiah Muralitharan's bowling action in 2002, as his comments were found to be in breach of the clause in the player code of conduct relating to ""detrimental public comment"".  During the 2003 World Cup, Gilchrist accused Pakistani wicketkeeper Rashid Latif of making a racist remark towards him while the latter was batting in their group match. Latif who was cleared by match referee Clive Lloyd, threatened to sue Gilchrist for this claim.

You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.,"I got a question for you: The flying shuttle was one of the key developments in the industrialization of weaving during the early Industrial Revolution. It allowed a single weaver to weave much wider fabrics, and it could be mechanized, allowing for automatic machine looms. The flying shuttle, which was patented by John Kay (1704 -- c. 1779) in 1733, greatly sped up the previous hand process and halved the labour force. Where a broad-cloth loom previously required a weaver on each side, it could now be worked by a single operator. Until this point the textile industry had required four spinners to service one weaver. Kay's innovation, in wide use by the 1750s, greatly increased this disparity.

 the prize has only been awarded three times. 
  
 a Sudanese-British telecoms tycoon and philanthropist, established the London-based Mo Ibrahim Foundation to help inspire good governance and exceptional leaders. By finding so few candidates that meet its standards, critics of the award argue it reinforces negative stereotypes about African leaders. 
  
 the relationship between rising inequality and worsening rule of law, and the controversy surrounding the International Criminal Court's (ICC) focus on African leaders. 
  
 Al Jazeera: Were there any leaders who might have qualified who were under consideration for the Mo Ibrahim Prize this year? 
  
 I'm not a member of the prize committee, but according to the rules, the committee looks at the people that left office in the last three years, peacefully. It is up to the prize committee to decide whether people meet the standard. We set a very high standard, of course. And we are proud of our prize committee for being credible and tough. It's a prize for excellence, it's not a pension. 
  
000 a year for life Winners include Botswana's Festus Mogae, Mozambique's Joaquim Chissano.and Cape Verde's Pedro Verona Pires Eligible leaders must have been democratically elected and have left office peacefully within the last three years In 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2013 no award was given 
  
 perhaps to include the many non-heads of state who are playing a positive transformative role? 
  
 a prize, for a specific reason. We should not tinker with that. If there is a need to offer prizes to wonderful parliamentarians, to great newsmen or women, to footballers, or whoever, that's fine. But we should not just mix up things together and destroy the brand we have just because one or two years we don't have a winner. 
  
 given the power they have. We have not cornered the market on prizes and we invite everybody else to offer prizes for civil society, for the best NGO, for whatever.

 AJ: The Ibrahim Index of African Governance ranking countries according to their performance was also released today. You have said that the information collated in the index is an important empowering tool for citizens in the countries surveyed. In what ways can citizens use this information? 
  
 From the 2013 Ibrahim Index of African Governance 
  
 MI: This is a scorecard. It shows exactly what has been achieved over the last 13 years. We've been publishing very detailed data over 13 years. We have 133 parameters we measure. It gives people full details: How effective is the police force? How effective is the judiciary? Women's social and economic rights… 
  
 for people to see what is strong, to keep doing it, and what needs to be fixed. It also gives an opportunity to compare your performance with that of your neighbour, to enable conversations, peer review. We can pick up the phone and say ""What are you doing here""? 
  
 they open up the index. They love it, because it can help them improve their performance. 
  
 or you think it is part of a global trend? 
  
 they build their institutions and it keeps them on the right path. 
  
 actually there have been a lot of changes. The best improvement, actually, has been from some of the countries at the bottom, that managed to get out of poverty and did not fall back into the vicious cycle of poverty. 
  
 somehow appear to be limited to the top one percent of the population. That is producing a widening gap between the wealthy and the poor. That produces tension. This phenomenon is not just an African phenomenon, it's happening in the US, it's happening in the UK, it's happening everywhere. 
  
 This is dangerous. You are building tension inside society. You will reach a point where social cohesion is destroyed. 
  
 AJ: The index also showed a trend of worsening levels of personal safety and the rule of law. What are the factors driving these trends? 
  
 MI: I just told you. 
  
 AJ: That it's due to the inequality? 
  
 MI: Exactly. Most of the violence before was happening because of tensions and hostilities across borders. Now it is happening because of conflict within the country. We need to look [at] why are we are lacking social cohesion. 
  
 From the 2013 Ibrahim Index of African Governance 
  
 AJ: You've spoken in the past about how Africa's youthful population gives it the possibility of becoming the next ""factory of the world"". Which countries do you think are best place to do this? 
  
 better training for young people. We need people who are able to serve the new economy. We need people who are versed in the new software, people who are good with their hands, smart kids. 
  
 and there are many African leaders who agree with him. Do you think there is any truth to their assertion that the ICC has targeted African leaders unfairly? If so, what's the alternative? 
  
 the allegation that the ICC has only tried or prosecuted African leaders is correct. Do atrocities only happen in Africa? What is happening in Myanmar, what is happening in Baghdad? Where is the ICC? That's a valid question. 
  
 Africa has no alternative to the ICC. We don’t have an African criminal court that is capable of really trying crimes against humanity. So when we have victims in Africa – and we do have victims in many cases – who can give them justice? 
  
 we need to find a way to reconcile the two. We need to find a way to the ICC so that it doesn't become just a political tool, as it is perceived by some African leaders. 
  
 we need the United Nations, what we need to do it to try and reform it, because we need it. 
  
 and find a way to move forward.

Title: The Lady Vanishes Movie plot: In a fictional country in a highly mountainous region of Europe, a motley group of travelers is delayed by an avalanche that has blocked the railway tracks. The passengers cram into a small village hotel for the night. Among the hotel guests eager to return to England are two British gentlemen, Caldicott and Charters, who are worried about missing the upcoming cricket Test match. The only room left for them is the maid's room. Other Britons are Iris (Margaret Lockwood), a young woman of independent means who has spent a holiday with some friends, now returning home to be married, Miss Froy (May Whitty), an elderly lady who has worked some years abroad as a governess and music teacher, Gilbert (Michael Redgrave), a young musicologist who has been studying the folk songs of the region, and a secretive couple Mr. and Mrs. Todhunter (Cecil Parker and Linden Travers) who are having a clandestine affair. Folk dancers stomp loudly in Gilbert's room just above Iris, making it impossible for Miss Froy to properly hear a musician singing a haunting melody out in the street. Iris bribes the manager to throw Gilbert out of his room. Gilbert retaliates by barging into Iris's room and refusing to leave. Miss Froy seems to particularly enjoy the musician in the street below, and she throws a coin out her window. The music stops, as a murderous hand is seen to strangle the balladeer, but no one seems to notice anything wrong.The next morning, as the passengers are leaving the hotel to board the train, Miss Froy asks Iris for help in finding her luggage. They huddle around a pile of baggage, and just then a flowerpot is pushed off a window ledge from an upper floor. The pot appears meant for Miss Froy, but it knocks Iris on the head, instead. She says she is all right and gets on the train, but drops unconscious once aboard. When she recovers, she finds herself seated in a compartment across from Miss Froy, who has evidently helped her. In the compartment are other passengers who appear not to understand English.Iris and Miss...

The eastern half of the system merged into the Soo Line Railroad on January 1, 1986. The company went through several official names and faced bankruptcy several times in that period. The railroad no longer exists as a separate entity, but much of its trackage continues to be used by its successor and other roads, and is commemorated in buildings like the historic Milwaukee Road Depot in Minneapolis, Minnesota and in railroad hardware still maintained by railfans, such as the Milwaukee Road 261 steam locomotive.  - Wisconsin Central Ltd. is a railroad subsidiary of the Canadian National Railway. At one time, its parent Wisconsin Central Transportation Corporation owned or operated railroads in the United States, Canada (Algoma Central Railway), the United Kingdom (English Welsh & Scottish), New Zealand (Tranz Rail), and Australia (Australian Transport Network).  - The Soo Line Railroad is the primary United States railroad subsidiary of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP), controlled through the Soo Line Corporation, and one of seven U.S. Class I railroads. Although it is named for the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad (MStP&SSM), which was commonly known as the Soo Line after the phonetic spelling of Sault, it was formed in 1961 by the consolidation of that company with two other CP subsidiaries, the Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railroad and Wisconsin Central Railroad. It is also the successor to other Class I railroads, including the Minneapolis, Northfield and Southern Railway (acquired 1982) and Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road, acquired at bankruptcy in 1985). On the other hand, a large amount of mileage was spun off in 1987 to Wisconsin Central Ltd., now part of the Canadian National Railway. The Soo Line and the Delaware and Hudson Railway, the CP's other major subsidiary (before the 2008 DM&E acquisition), presently do business as the Canadian Pacific Railway, and most equipment has been repainted into the CP's scheme, but the U.S. Surface Transportation Board groups all CP's U.S. subsidiaries under the Soo Line name for reporting purposes.  - Thep Delaware and Hudson Railway is a railroad that operates in the northeastern United States that has been since 1991 owned and operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway under the rail subsidiary Soo Line Corporation also controls the Soo Line Railroad, Canadian Pacific Railway is owned by Canadian Pacific Railway Limited.  - Cisco is a place name for the remnants of a former unincorporated community located along the Soo Line Railroad and US 59 in the NW 1/4 of Section 11 of Badger Township , 149 North , Range 42 West , in Polk County , United States , approximately four miles north of the city of Erskine , and about the same distance south of the city of Brooks . Cisco was still in use as a place name by local people as late as 1990 , but now is but a dim memory among some of the old - timers .  - The Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad was a Class I railroad subsidiary of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the Midwest United States. Commonly known as the Soo Line after the phonetic spelling of Sault, it was merged with several other major CP subsidiaries on January 1, 1961 to form the Soo Line Railroad. As time passes, more and more Soo Line equipment is being repainted into the Canadian Pacific's current paint scheme, slowly erasing the Soo's identity as a subsidiary railroad.  - The Surface Transportation Board (STB) of the United States is a bipartisan, decisionally-independent adjudicatory body organizationally housed within the U.S. Department of Transportation. The STB was established in 1996 to assume some of the regulatory functions that had been administered by the Interstate Commerce Commission when the ICC was abolished. Other ICC regulatory functions were either eliminated or transferred to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration or to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics within DOT.  - The Canadian National Railway Company is a Canadian Class I railway headquartered in Montreal, Quebec that serves Canada and the Midwestern and Southern United States. CN's slogan is """"North America's Railroad"""". CN is a public company with 24,000 employees. It had a market capitalization of 32 billion CAD in 2011. CN was government-owned, having been a Canadian Crown corporation from its founding to its privatization in 1995. Bill Gates was, in 2011, the largest single shareholder of CN stock.  - The Minneapolis, Northfield and Southern Railway was an American short line railroad connecting Minneapolis and Northfield, Minnesota. It was incorporated in 1918 to take over the trackage of the former Minneapolis, St. Paul, Rochester and Dubuque Electric Traction Company, also known as the Dan Patch Lines. On 2 June 1982 it was acquired by the Soo Line Railroad, which operated it as a separate railroad until merging it on January 1, 1986.

Instead of finding Daniel, Laura finds his son Danny (Fox) of whom Uncle Joe had always been especially fond when he was a little boy. Professional bowler Danny left the family with his father, but he accepts the cousins' invitation to return â after rolling a gutter ball in a big tournament and finding out that he has a pre-arthritic condition developing in his wrist.

While Duisenberg had been the head of the EMI (taking over from Alexandre Lamfalussy of Belgium) just before the ECB came into existence, the French government wanted Jean-Claude Trichet, former head of the French central bank, to be the ECB's first president. The French argued that since the ECB was to be located in Germany, its president should be French.

It’s set in Taranto, Puglia, on Italy’s southern heel and involves my daughter’s great-great-grandmother. The best known version is told by my husband Marco’s uncle, Riccardo, who remembers it being told to him by his elderly Nonna Anna herself. Anna Michela Comasia Maria Calianno. Her long name was a sign of her family’s noble status. She was born in Taranto, Puglia, in 1889, into a wealthy, well-educated Tarantine family of physicians, surgeons and landowners. One day, by chance, young Anna answered the door instead of the butler. There was Nicola Cardellicchio, the postman. He came from a poor family of bricklayers and wool spinners, raised by a single mother. “He was no adonis,” noted Nonna Anna. Nicola was rather short and stocky, but she liked him immediately. She continued answering the door whenever the postman passed. When Anna’s mother, Girolama, noticed her daughter’s growing interest in the postman, she forbid her to see him again, threatening to disown her. So Anna did what any lovesick girl would do: she ran away, eloping with Nicola. The couple had nine children in Taranto — Mario, Marco’s grandfather was born in the middle of the First World War — but times were very hard, and they moved north to Torino to look for work. Nonna Anna was perhaps not an instinctive cook. I wondered whether she ever had the possibility to learn how to cook. Her grandchildren, Angela (my mother in law) and Riccardo, remember her only ever making lesso (boiled meat) and these polpette, which became variously known in the family as “sugo di nonna Anna” and, oddly, “amatriciana” (which is actually a different recipe, a chilli-spiked sauce of fried guanciale and tomato to coat pasta). But these polpette – plump meat balls, cooked slowly in tomato sauce, a very traditional dish from Puglia – were passed down to Anna’s daughter in law, Angela’s Tuscan mother, Lina, who made them so often for her own family that she in turn taught her daughter in law,...

If the question isn't answerable, please output ""Can't answer"". Question: what was dr. hartz's patient's face covered by?cov Title: The Lady Vanishes Movie plot: In a fictional country in a highly mountainous region of Europe, a motley group of travelers is delayed by an avalanche that has blocked the railway tracks. The passengers cram into a small village hotel for the night. Among the hotel guests eager to return to England are two British gentlemen, Caldicott and Charters, who are worried about missing the upcoming cricket Test match. The only room left for them is the maid's room. Other Britons are Iris (Margaret Lockwood), a young woman of independent means who has spent a holiday with some friends, now returning home to be married, Miss Froy (May Whitty), an elderly lady who has worked some years abroad as a governess and music teacher, Gilbert (Michael Redgrave), a young musicologist who has been studying the folk songs of the region, and a secretive couple Mr. and Mrs. Todhunter (Cecil Parker and Linden Travers) who are having a clandestine affair. Folk dancers stomp loudly in Gilbert's room just above Iris, making it impossible for Miss Froy to properly hear a musician singing a haunting melody out in the street. Iris bribes the manager to throw Gilbert out of his room. Gilbert retaliates by barging into Iris's room and refusing to leave. Miss Froy seems to particularly enjoy the musician in the street below, and she throws a coin out her window. The music stops, as a murderous hand is seen to strangle the balladeer, but no one seems to notice anything wrong.The next morning, as the passengers are leaving the hotel to board the train, Miss Froy asks Iris for help in finding her luggage. They huddle around a pile of baggage, and just then a flowerpot is pushed off a window ledge from an upper floor. The pot appears meant for Miss Froy, but it knocks Iris on the head, instead. She says she is all right and gets on the train, but drops unconscious once aboard. When she recovers, she finds herself seated in a compartment across from Miss Froy, who has evidently helped her. In the compartment are other passengers who appear not to understand English.Iris and Miss...

 Lemon’s time with the Globetrotters paralleled the rise of the N.B.A. When he joined the team, the Globetrotters were still better known than the Knicks and the Boston Celtics and played for bigger crowds than they did. When he left, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson were about to enter the N.B.A. and propel it to worldwide popularity. In between, the league became thoroughly accommodating to black players, competing with the Globetrotters for their services and eventually usurping the Trotters as the most viable employer of top black basketball talent. 
  
 the Globetrotters became less of a competitive basketball team and more of an entertainment troupe through the 1960s and ’70s. They became television stars, hosting variety specials and playing themselves on shows like “The White Shadow” and a made-for-TV “Gilligan’s Island” movie; they inspired a Saturday morning cartoon show. 
  
 as the Globetrotters took on local teams and challenged college all-star squads, they played to win, generally using straight basketball skills until the outcome was assured. But as time went on, for the fans who came to see them, the outcome was no longer the point. 
  
 1971, the Globetrotters were beaten in Martin, Tenn., by an ordinarily more obliging team, the New Jersey Reds. It was the first time they had lost in almost nine years, the end of a 2,495-game winning streak. But perhaps more remarkable than the streak itself was the fact that it ended at all, given that the Trotters’ opponents by then were generally forbidden to interfere with passes to Lemon in the middle or to interrupt the familiar reams. 
  
 as the stellar attraction, thrived in this environment, but he also became a lightning rod for troubles within the Globetrotter organization. As the civil rights movement gained momentum, the players’ antics on the court drew criticism from outside for reinforcing what many considered to be demeaning black stereotypes, and Lemon drew criticism from inside. 
  
 he was also, by far, the highest-paid Globetrotter, and his teammates associated him more with management than with themselves. When the players went on strike for higher pay in 1971, Lemon, who negotiated his own salary, did not join them. 
  
 the team changed hands several times, and in 1978, according to “Spinning the Globe: The Rise, Fall and Return to Greatness of the Harlem Globetrotters” (2005), by Ben Green, Lemon was dismissed after a salary dispute. He subsequently formed his own traveling teams — Meadowlark Lemon’s Bucketeers, the Shooting Stars and Meadowlark Lemon’s Harlem All-Stars — and continued performing into his 70s. ||||| The interactive transcript could not be loaded.

 N.C., at age 11, he didn't have much going for him. He was born a second-class citizen in the Jim Crow South. His folks had split up, leaving his aunt and uncle to raise him -- a skinny boy with a funny name ""not at the top of anyone's priority list,"" as he later wrote. And, for a kid who looked forward to splurging 25 cents on Westerns and adventure flicks, there was no clear way out. 
  
 in the early 1940s, Lemon saw the newsreel that changed his life. 
  
"" he later wrote. ""The players in the newsreel were unlike any I had ever seen. ... They laughed, danced and did ball tricks as they stood in a 'Magic Circle' and passed the ball to a jazzy tune called 'Sweet Georgia Brown.' How they could play!"" He added: ""There was one other thing that was different about them, though. They were all black men. The same color as me."" 
  
 Globetrotters spokesman Brett Meister said Lemon's wife and daughter confirmed -- dreamed what seemed like an impossible dream: to play for the Globetrotters and conquer the globe. Yet it came true. 
  
 awesome, incredible basketball player I've ever seen,"" basketball great Wilt Chamberlain, Lemon's onetime teammate, said in a television interview shortly before his death in 1999, as the Times reported. ""People would say it would be Dr. J or even Jordan. For me, it would be Meadowlark Lemon."" 
  
 Lemon began with virtually nothing: a basketball hoop fashioned out of an onion sack and a wire coat hanger nailed to a tree behind a neighbor's house. His ball was an empty Carnation evaporated milk can salvaged from the garbage. 
  
 Eventually those modest efforts led to greater things. Lemon was pulled out of a pickup game by a coach who saw his talent. The coach taught him the fundamentals -- including the hook shot that would make Lemon famous.

 however, was loath to give his mentor all the credit, saying he continued to work on the shot every day even after he perfected it. 
  
"" he wrote in a 2010 memoir. ""... It was me."" 
  
 Lemon landed back in Wilmington after an unsuccessful stint playing at Florida A&M. He was considering joining the Army in the middle of the Korean War when a high-school coach got him his dream shot: a tryout with the Globetrotters in Raleigh, N.C. In front of 15,000 people, Lemon played for a quarter and a half and scored 12 points. 
  
 the team wasn't ready for him. So Lemon enlisted and, while serving in Austria, tried out again when the Globetrotters visited Europe. The result: a 40-game contract for a European tour that turned into a career as the ""Clown Prince of Basketball"" of the franchise that spanned two decades. 
  
 comedy isn't enough. 
  
"" Lemon said in 1977. ""You first had to prove that you could play basketball, then you had to show that you could be funny."" 
  
 awesome, incredible basketball player I've ever seen. People would say it would be Dr. J or even Jordan. For me, it would be Meadowlark Lemon. — Wilt Chamberlain 
  
 in the middle of the 20th century, the Globetrotters were more than a novelty act. When Lemon joined in 1954, the NBA had integrated just six years before. Owned by the very white, very Jewish Abe Saperstein -- who embraced the novel idea, missed by many of his contemporaries, that some black people could actually play basketball -- the team was a showcase for African-American players, including Chamberlain, who played for a year with Lemon. Though sometimes criticized for its buffoonish image -- for ""Tomming for Abe,"" as detractors put it -- in the civil rights era, the Globetrotters always had many defenders. 
  
"" Jesse Jackson once said. ""... They did not show blacks as stupid. On the contrary, they were shown as superior."" 
  
"" Lemon wrote. ""They had done more for the perception of black people and for the perception of America than almost anything you could think of."" He added: ""Some people say that the Globetrotters kept the NBA in business in its early years."" 
  
 there was room for levity -- a lot of it. In vaudevillian gags known as ""reems,"" the Globetrotters would torture referees, fake injuries, line up in football or baseball formations or douse one another with water. Lemon became the ringmaster of this circus, playing up to 10 games per week for 2 million paying customers around the world per year. With the Globetrotters and a subsequent comedy basketball teams he formed, he played in an East German swimming pool and a Mexican bullfighting ring. He played before two popes and met President Ronald Reagan. 
  
 the father of 10 children, missed a lot at home, where life was not always placid. Indeed, Lemon divorced his first wife, who was arrested in 1978 after a car chase between the unhappy couple ended with her stabbing him at 53rd Street and Second Avenue in New York. 
  
"" Lemon said when he was inducted into the basketball hall of fame in 2003, saying sorry to his family for the Globetrotters' punishing tour schedule. 
  
 he was perhaps prouder of his performance in another arena: He was ordained as a minister in 1986, according to his website. 
  
 and an Ambassador of Good Will in Short Pants to the world, which is an honor,"" he wrote. ""To be a child of God is the highest honor anyone could have."" 
  
 he laid credit for all he had accomplished on the court and off at the feet of the Almighty. 
  
"" Lemon wrote. ""He gave me a relentless desire, determination, energy, and the talent to make my dream come true."" |||||"

 he was born at Aberdeen in June 1873. He was educated at both Aberdeen Grammar School and Galashiels Academy, before studying engineering at Heriot Watt Engineering School. He served in the Royal Navy, firstly as an assistant engineer, before being promoted to the rank of engineer in June 1902. He served as an engineering instructor at the Britannia Royal Naval College for over twenty years. He was appointed as the superintendent overseeing the construction of in 1902, joining the ship when it was commissioned in 1905. A keen cricketer, Murray made a single first-class cricket appearance for the Royal Navy, making his debut against the British Army cricket team at Lord's in 1913. Batting twice in the match, he was dismissed without scoring in the Royal Navy's first-innings by Harold Fawcus, while in their second-innings he was dismissed for 29 runs by the same bowler. Murray served in the First World War, during which he was seconded to the battleship . He served aboard the ship at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916, when he was killed after the ship exploded and sank.
 in 1995, he was signed by Bologna at the request of the club's sporting director at the time, Gabriele Oriali; Paramatti would make a name for himself with the club due to his consistent performances, eventually being named Bologna's captain. During his first season with the club, he helped Bologna to obtain Serie A promotion, winning the 1995–96 Serie B title. During the 1997–98 season under manager Renzo Ulivieri, he played alongside several notable players, such as Roberto Baggio, Giancarlo Marocchi, Igor Kolyvanov, and Kennet Andersson, helping Bologna to qualify for the 1998 UEFA Intertoto Cup. Bologna won the tournament the following season under Carlo Mazzone, qualifying for the 1998–99 UEFA Cup; the club would go on to reach the semi-finals of the competition, with Paramatti scoring in the return leg against Olympique Marseille. That season, the club also managed a semi-final finish in the Coppa Italia.

It's a five-year trend of sweeping church closures that most recently hit Cleveland, Ohio. St. James parish in Lakewood, Ohio, is slated to close. The interior replicates a 16th-century Sicilian cathedral. Wally Martens, a Cleveland native, can look out his kitchen window and see the spiritual home that has served his family for five generations. St. Ignatius of Antioch has been with him and his loved ones through life and death. ""It's the place where most of us were baptized, most of us got married, most of us graduated from grade school and some of us were buried,"" Martens, 68, said of the west side urban parish that serves 1,200 households. To find out that the building is set to be shuttered is ""like losing somebody in your family."" Earlier this month, Bishop Richard G. Lennon of the Diocese of Cleveland, which serves more than 750,000 Catholics, announced that 29 parishes will close and 41 others will merge. The reconfiguration plan, which will effectively cut 52 parishes in the current tally of 224, is scheduled to go into effect by June 30, 2010. ""Closing a parish is very emotional,"" Bishop Lennon said in a written statement. ""I have personally experienced the closing of my own childhood parish in Boston, which members of my family helped establish in 1914. ... I pray that my decisions will serve the needs of this Diocese and its people.""  Parishioners speak out on closings ». Other cities that have had waves of closures have included places as various as Camden, New Jersey; Allentown, Pennsylvania; and New York City. All of this comes at a time when the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life reports that Catholicism in America has lost more affiliated members than any other faith tradition. There are reportedly 67.1 million Catholics in the U.S., according to The Official Catholic Directory 2008. Compared to the 2007 number of 67.5, that's about a 400,000 decrease in one year. And the Pew Forum found that approximately a third of its survey respondents who were raised in the Roman Catholic Church no longer attend the church. What drove the decision to close parishes in Cleveland were population shifts to outlying areas, financial strains that have 42 percent of parishes ""operating in the red"" and priest shortages, diocese spokesman Robert Tayek explained. The bishop, he said, is trying to find ""an equitable solution."" But the announcement has raised many questions. Among them: What happens to the struggling neighborhoods that have come to rely on outreach and programs offered by some of these inner-city parishes? ""Too many bishops are treating parishes as if they were Starbucks franchises,"" said Sister Christine Schenk, a Cleveland-area nun who's been fighting for nearly two decades to institute change in the church through her organization FutureChurch. ""It's about more than money. It's about mission to the people,"" she said. ""This isn't what Jesus would do."" The Rev. Bob Begin of Saint Colman couldn't agree more. ""The founder of our church started his mission by saying, 'I came to bring good news to the poor,'"" said Begin, who described his parish as serving about 1,300 people in a community where the average income is below $20,000. Saint Colman, which is slated to merge with another parish elsewhere, gets daily knocks on its doors from nearby residents, many of them immigrants from 25 different countries, who are in need of all kinds of assistance, he said. ""If this parish weren't involved in bringing good news to the poor, I would not spend a lick of energy trying to keep it open,"" the pastor said. ""But because it is bringing good news to the poor, then I have a responsibility to guard and defend this mission against anyone who threatens it."" His parish and others affected by the recent announcement had until 5 p.m. Friday to file an appeal with the diocese.  According to The Plain Dealer, which conducted a survey of the parishes, at least 11 had filed as of Friday morning. The diocese itself refused to comment on numbers. For those who didn't file, the bishop's decision is final. But if what happened in Boston, Massachusetts, is any indication, no parish should count on the appeal working. Bishop Lennon came to Cleveland from the Archdiocese of Boston, where he oversaw the reorganization and closure of parishes and came under harsh criticism from many. One such critic was Peter Borré, chairman of the Council of Parishes, a Boston-based advocacy group for imperiled parishes. In 2004, within months of the Archdiocese of Boston announcing it would pay a settlement of $85 million to more than 500 alleged sex abuse victims, 83 parishes were put on the chopping block, ""which was a head spinner,"" Borré said. In the end, because of his organization's relentless efforts, Borré said, only 60 parishes were cut. His group coordinated around-the-clock vigils or sit-ins that are ongoing, four and a half years later, in five Boston-area parishes. He also has led the charge to navigate the appeal process for nine parishioner groups that have now taken their battle all the way up to the Apostolic Signatura, or, as Borré called it, the ""Vatican Supreme Court."" The assumption is that the highest level of the Vatican will deny the appeals this spring, but Borré said it is important to him and the others to fight as far as they can go. ""Other than vigils, this is the only step still open to us,"" he said. ""Secondly, we are the lead dog on this sled. We are the first that has experienced this phenomenon, and we have made it a self-appointed task to let the rest of America know what to expect."" As of Friday morning, eight Cleveland parishes had reached out to Borré for language to help in their appeals. Others likely drafted letters of their own. But some affected parishes had no intention of fighting. Ray Daull, 68, a deacon at Christ the King in Cleveland Heights says a merger, which will combine his parish with three others, is a good thing. It'll be sad to see his church of 52 years go, but given its deficit and shrinking attendance, with a merger, ""We will have more resources ... and the money can go into doing our work,"" he said. But for parishes such as St. Ignatius of Antioch, the one Wally Martens can see from his window, accepting the end is not yet possible. ""There was a general gasp, and then sadness turned to madness,"" the Rev. James McGonegdal, Marten's pastor of 20 years, said of the announcement he made at Mass on March 15. ""Some of the parishes knew they'd be closing, whereas for St. Ignatius and a couple other parishes, it was almost like a sudden death. You grieve in a different way."" A standing-room only crowd poured into the parish last Sunday to show growing support. Martens said in a week's time, $900,000 had been pledged to finance the church and send a message to the diocese. For Martens' 92-year-old mother, Pauline, pondering life without her parish is unthinkable. For most of her life, it's the only one she's known. ""I just thought the church would go on forever,"" she said. ""I expected to be buried from there. But I guess the way things are going, I just don't know what'll happen to me.""

"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.","New study has identified 17 discrete expressions in horses (three more than chimpanzees) which may give researchers insight into their emotional states 
  
 it has one already. But it can and does look down its nose at you. It can be insistent, if not a nag. Horses are expressive, but those who want to decipher their expressions have a few hurdles yet to jump. 
  
 But the chase is on. Scientists at the University of Sussex have compiled a directory of facial expression in one of humanity’s oldest four-legged friends. Their Equine Facial Action Coding System (EquiFACS for short) has identified 17 discrete facial movements in horses that may indicate mood or intention or just bafflement. 
  
 with the lips and eyes and the occasional wrinkled nose. 
  
 with eyesight that’s better than domestic cats and dogs, yet their use of facial expression has been largely overlooked. What surprised us was the rich repertoire of complex facial movements in horses, and how many of them are similar to humans,” said Jennifer Watham, a doctoral researcher and one of the lead authors. 
  
 we were able to identify some similar expressions in relation to movements of lips and eyes. What we’ll now be looking at is how these expressions relate to emotional states.” 
  
 sketch and photograph all the elements of facial musculature. The researchers then recorded 15 hours of natural behaviour in 86 horses, aged from four weeks to 27 years taking in both male and female and a range of breeds . The search for variety embraced rescued horses, riding schools and farms. And then the team charted all possible twitches of their horse-faced subjects. 
  
 as seen in this video. 
  
 Asia and North America during the Ice Ages, between 2.5 million and 12,000 years ago. They were hunted for food, but then were first domesticated around 5,000 years ago. Bythe mid-20th century, the species Equus ferus had become extinct in the wild. The horse changed human society – it delivered mounted cavalry, the notion of chivalry, and the original measure of horsepower for economic development. It became a draught animal, a farm worker, a military steed, a sporting hunter and the foundation of one of the world’s oldest and biggest gambling industries. 
  
 with collaborators from the University of Portsmouth and Duquesne University in Pennsylvania, turns history on its head. It is the commencement of a long cool look at how humanity might have changed the horse, and how the look in a colt’s eye, or a frisky glance from a filly, or a Clydesdale’s curling lip – could answer complex questions about the social, cognitive and physical characteristics of biology on the hoof. The Sussex study – a catalogue of eye, lip, nostril, chin and other movements - is just a beginning. 
  
 which seems to happen in negative emotional states,” said Watham. “Another example is the retraction of lip corners, which seems to be part of a submissive gesture in horses. Our paper has only identified the movements horses can make – the challenge now is to document what contexts these occur in, and then we will be able to make more informed comparisons.” 
  
 and to warn of possible predator attack. But the range of possible expression remained a surprise. 
  
 in terms of other species, the further away an animal was from humans, the more rudimentary their use of facial expressions would be,” said Karen McComb, professor of animal behaviour at Sussex, and the other lead author. 
  
 however, it’s apparent that horses, with their complex and fluid social systems, also have an extensive range of facial movements and share many of these with humans and other animals. This contributes to a growing body of evidence suggesting that social factors have had a significant influence on the evolution of facial expression.” ||||| Different Faces, Same Smiles 
  
 a new study finds. 
  
 published in the journal PLOS ONE, found that, like humans, horses use muscles underlying various facial features, including their nostrils, lips and eyes. These alter their facial expressions in a variety of situations. 
  
 and to me it seems likely that horses have evolved a wide range of facial expressions to help them communicate effectively with other members of their species,"" lead author Jennifer Wathan of the University of Sussex told Discovery News. 
  
 ""I think what surprised me most was that we didn't expect horses to have any similarities with humans at all. They're two such distantly related species and, at first glance, have such differently shaped faces."" 
  
 that is not yet known. The researchers are still investigating what emotions are tied to the horse facial expressions. 
  
 e.g. pain, until now there has been no methodology available that documents all the possible facial movements of the horse and provides a way to record all potential facial configurations. This is essential for an objective description of horse facial expressions across a range of contexts that reflect different emotional states. Facial Action Coding Systems (FACS) provide a systematic methodology of identifying and coding facial expressions on the basis of underlying facial musculature and muscle movement. FACS are anatomically based and document all possible facial movements rather than a configuration of movements associated with a particular situation. Consequently, FACS can be applied as a tool for a wide range of research questions. We developed FACS for the domestic horse (Equus caballus) through anatomical investigation of the underlying musculature and subsequent analysis of naturally occurring behaviour captured on high quality video. Discrete facial movements were identified and described in terms of the underlying muscle contractions, in correspondence with previous FACS systems. The reliability of others to be able to learn this system (EquiFACS) and consistently code behavioural sequences was high—and this included people with no previous experience of horses. A wide range of facial movements were identified, including many that are also seen in primates and other domestic animals (dogs and cats). EquiFACS provides a method that can now be used to document the facial movements associated with different social contexts and thus to address questions relevant to understanding social cognition and comparative psychology, as well as informing current veterinary and animal welfare practices.

 a Facial Action Coding System for the domestic horse (Equus caballus). Until now, there has been no methodology available that documented all of the facial movements of the horse, allowing a record of all potential facial configurations. There are a number of studies that focus on the facial expressions of horses in one specific context, for example pain [2, 3]. However, EquiFACS provides a comprehensive list of all the facial movements that horses can produce, which can be used to document facial expressions across a wide range of contexts. What Are Facial Action Coding Systems? FACS are objective coding systems for describing facial behaviour. The facial muscles (sometimes known as the mimetic muscles) are a subgroup of muscles innervated by CN7 (the facial nerve). They are characterised by their extensive connections to the superficial fascia and skin of the face, and consequently are responsible for observable changes in the skin (facial movements or expressions) [4]. FACS are frameworks where designated codes (Action Units or AUs) represent the contraction of a particular facial muscle (or set of muscles) and the resulting facial movements [1]. Action Descriptors (ADs) are also used for more general facial movements where the muscular basis either cannot be identified or is the result of a different muscle set (e.g. deep muscles). This creates a reliable system that people can be trained to use and that describes facial actions in a standardised way, avoiding subjective assessments of expression. This is particularly important as the recording and analysis of facial expressions can be subject to a large degree of observer bias and influenced by the perceived emotional context [5–7]. Consequently, frameworks that quantify behaviour and allow reliable, objective measurements are needed. The original FACS was developed for use in humans [1] and this framework has since been applied to a number of different primates and domestic animals (chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)[8], orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus)[9], rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta)[10], hylobatids (gibbons and siamangs)[11], dogs (Canis familiaris)[12] and cats (Felis catus)[13]. This methodology provides compatible systems that allow direct comparisons using identical techniques across species with a different facial morphology (e.g. [14]). EquiFACS is the first attempt to develop this system for an animal with laterally placed eyes and an elongated face. Why Are Horses an Interesting Model? Horses belong to the order Perissodactyla, and within this they are one of nine species in the family Equus. By the end of the Pleistocene era (approx. 2.5 million – 12,000 years ago) wild horses (Equus ferus) roamed across Europe, Asia and North America, and it is estimated that the domestication of horses began around 5000 years ago [15]. However, by the middle of the twentieth century horses had become extinct in the wild, yet were thriving as a domestic species [16]. Domestication can dramatically influence the social, cognitive, and morphological characteristics of a species, and the study of domestic species is of great interest from both welfare and evolutionary perspectives [17–19]. Horses are long-lived social animals. Feral populations have demonstrated that without domestic pressures horses would live in a society comprising of several small groups or ‘bands’ that share space and resources, and to which membership stays relatively stable over time. Bands have large, overlapping ranges so horses regularly come into contact with many other conspecifics, and inter-band dominance indicates that within the larger herd established social relationships exist [20]. Consequently, horses show fission-fusion dynamics; a variation of the same complex social organisation that is seen in humans, bonobos, chimpanzees, and macaques, as well as elephants, spotted hyenas and many cetaceans [21]. Group life in these societies is determined by complex, long-term social relationships that must be maintained, suggesting effective communication would be adaptive [22]. Horses are predominantly visual animals, with reasonable visual acuity that, at 23 cycles per degree, is better than domestic cats and dogs [23–25]. While horses’ use of head and body posture in signaling has been described in observational literature (e.g. [20] and [26]), surprisingly their use of facial expressions has been largely overlooked. This is despite attempts to quantify facial expressions in horses’ close relatives, plains zebra (Equus quagga [27]), and reports that horses do routinely use some apparently complex facial expressions (e.g. snapping and the estrous face, which both involve pulling back the lips and flattening of the ears [28]). A systematic way of recording facial expressions would have a wide range of uses, with the potential to assess and improve welfare for horses, as well as enhancing our understanding of communication and cognition in this highly social species and providing insights into the effects of domestication. Questions about whether particular facial movements are associated with negative emotional states or indicative of positive experiences will be particularly important to address, and FACS provides an ideal framework for such investigations. More generally, FACS provides a framework through which species with different phylogenetic and ecological influences can be compared to investigate the functional significance and evolutionary origins of facial expressions. How Was FACS Modified for Use in Horses? To modify FACS for use in non-human animals, the first step was to document and compare their facial anatomy [9–13, 29]. Horses are only distantly related to primates and the other animals FACS have previously been developed for; additionally horses have a dramatically different facial morphology to these animals, including laterally placed eyes, elongated faces, and raised zygomatic arches. Consequently, it is possible that the facial muscles of horses would show little similarity with the facial muscles of humans or those underpinning other FACS. To facilitate valid comparisons across taxa, it is necessary to report findings in a consistent way, with a standardised nomenclature for the facial muscles [4]. While the anatomy of domestic mammals is generally well documented, it has been difficult to make direct comparisons between domestic animals and primates because of the inconsistent terminology used (see [4, 30] for reviews and a call for a standardized nomenclature for the facial muscles). Additionally, the anatomy of domestic mammals tends to be described from a veterinary perspective, so that the muscles of facial expression are often not documented comprehensively within one text (e.g. [31]). Therefore, we supplemented the previous literature on the facial anatomy of the horse with our own dissection using an innovative ‘face mask’ method, which allows a more complete view of the facial muscles and their attachments than traditional dissection methods [32–35]. In doing this we documented the muscles using the recommended terms, which allowed us to make direct comparisons between horses and the other species. The facial muscles of the horse are reported here using the standardised terminology [4], so that a free, detailed record of the muscles of facial expression is available alongside the EquiFACS manual. We then analysed footage of a wide range of naturally occurring horse behaviours captured on high quality video. Discrete facial movements were identified, their proposed muscular basis was noted, and they were given a code in correspondence with previous FACS systems. All the facial movements identified are listed in the results, accompanied by a description of the appearance changes and video illustrations. Where necessary, the proposed muscular basis of the actions is given and there are also sections on subtle differences between similar actions. 
  
 where the facial musculature is removed from the deep muscles and the skull with the skin, creating a ‘facial mask’ that holds all of the facial muscles (see S1 Text for full details of the dissection procedure). Using this novel approach preserves the superficially located facial muscles that might be lost in the traditional dissection method of removing the skin from the facial musculature. Furthermore, it provides a more complete picture of muscle attachments, by keeping superficial portions attached to the skin and deeper portions attached to the skull (see [32–35]). The muscles were examined for presence/absence, attachments to the bone, skin, and cartilage, as well as their three-dimensional relationships to one another and to the skull. Muscles were classified with reference to a variety of sources (mainly [36, 37]) and in relation to previous dissections completed for the development of FACS in other species [32–35]. All muscles and their attachments were recorded, sketched and photographed. Classifying Facial Actions We collected and analysed 15 hours of video footage of a wide range of naturally occurring horse behaviours from a sample of 86 horses. Known ages ranged from 4 weeks to 27 years, and the sample included horses of different breeds, coat colours, and sex. Horses were videoed using a Canon XM2 video recorder in a variety of situations, including interacting with conspecifics, humans and other animals (e.g. dogs), feeding and mating. Each discrete facial movement identified was given a code (an Action unit—AU—or an Action Descriptor—AD) in correspondence with previous FACS systems. Where EquiFACS identified movements analogous to those in humans or other animals, the same codes have been used. In some cases, although the same muscle is used in both humans and horses the resulting action on the face is very different; in these cases the Action Unit is prefixed with an ‘H’ e.g. AUH13. In other cases, although the action on the face is similar in horses and humans, the underlying muscular basis differs; in these cases the AU is prefixed by a 1 (e.g. AU122). Where novel movements were noted a new Action Unit or Descriptor was created (see Table 1 and Table 2). Agreement on these classifications was reached between two trained human FACS coders (JW and BMW), a comparative anatomist (AMB), and a specialist in animal behaviour (including horses) (KM).

 three of whom had no previous experience of FACS and one of whom had no previous experience of horses. The coders were each given the text, video examples, and practical instructions describing how to use EquiFACS effectively (see S3 Text) and asked to learn EquiFACS independently. The coders had minimum contact with the authors in this time, so that their performance would be considered a fair test of whether EquiFACS produces reliable coding when learned without training from the developers. When each coder was happy that they understood the principles of EquiFACS and felt they could reliably identify the expressions, they were asked to code 22 short video clips (containing the full range of AUs and EADs) with the manual for reference. In accordance with previous FACS, reliability was measured using Wexler’s ratio [1, 8–12, 38]. Wexler’s ratio is a ratio of the number of agreements (i.e. the number of AUs on which coder 1 and coder 2 agreed x 2) divided by the number of possibilities for agreement (i.e. the total number of AUs scored by both coders). This is particularly suitable for situations, such as in FACS, where there are a large number of potential codes and there is likely to be a different number of items coded by each coder. Each person’s coding was compared to JW’s coding, the agreement ratio was calculated for each video clip, and then an average over the video clips was taken for each coder. The overall average was 0.86 (coder 1 = 0.85; coder 2 = 0.86; coder 3 = 0.87; coder 4 = 0.85), demonstrating high reliability across the coders. Ethical Statement This study gained ethical approval from the University of Sussex Ethical Review Committee, and was carried out in accordance with the Association of Animal Behaviour Guidelines for the Treatment of Animals in Behavioural Research. All owners gave consent for their horses to be video recorded. It should be noted that the specimen for the dissection was not euthanised for the purpose of this study, but was acquired from a veterinary centre where the horse had been euthanised for clinical reasons.

 which is often also called the levator nasolabialis. Synonyms for the levator annuli oris fascialis muscle include the dilator nares muscle and the caninus muscle. The frontoscutularis has a frontal and a temporal arm. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131738.g001 Gross observations showed that the muscles around the ear, lips, and nose of the horse were particularly large and complex, with these muscles having many attachments to the fascia, cartilage, and other muscles (S2 and S3 Figs). In particular, many muscles of the lower face converged in the modiolus to form a large, complex muscular mass (S2 Figs). This was in contrast to previous suggestions that mammals distantly related to primates, such as Perissodactyla, should have very simple facial musculature, particularly around the lips and mid-face [39, 40]. The orbital and mid-face region of the horse had numerous muscles including both a zygomatic major and minor (also termed the malaris), and an extensive obicularis occuli, although the muscles in these areas were thinner than the muscles around the ears and lower face. There was a large amount of adipose compared to non-human primates, e.g. chimpanzee, [33]; rhesus macaques, [34] Otolemur [32] and Hylobatids [35], possibly due to the domestic situation of the horse. The adipose was particularly prevalent around the ear, but also found around the mouth (this has been cut away in the Figs to allow better observation of the muscles). 
  
 such as facial expressions, would be limited without standardised systems that allow quantification of behaviour and cross-species comparisons. Facial Action Coding Systems (FACS) provide a means of addressing this problem, and by developing a FACS for the domestic horse (EquiFACS) we have produced a tool that allows the systematic recording of horse facial expressions in any context, with the potential to make direct comparisons across species. EquiFACS is an anatomically based, objective system that contains all the facial actions horses can possibly produce, making it suitable for many different research questions. Horses have a rich facial repertoire, with 17 defined Action Units (AUs). Whilst this was less than the number of AUs humans display (27), it was slightly more than most other animals that FACS have been developed for (chimpanzees, 13, rhesus macaques, 13, orang-utans, 15, Hylobatids, 16, dogs, 16), with only cats displaying a larger facial repertoire (21, largely due to the extensive whisker and ear movements). The potential to make such cross species comparisons can enhance our understanding of the meaning, function, and evolution of communicative behaviour [14, 44]. In fact, many of the horse AUs were similar to the facial movements seen in other animals, including humans, chimpanzees, cats, and dogs. It was previously thought that humans possessed the most complex repertoire of facial expressions and that, in phylogenetic terms, the further away an animal was from humans, the more rudimentary their use of facial expressions would be. However, through the development of EquiFACS it is apparent that horses also have an extensive range of facial movements, sharing many Action Units with humans and other animals. This contributes to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the evolution of facial expressions was not driven entirely by phylogenetic pressures, but that other, socio-ecological factors had a significant influence [30, 35]. EquiFACS also provides those working in the horse community with a standardised language through which information can be shared, facilitating the investigation of questions relevant to horse management and welfare. It should be noted that whilst some of the video examples given with this manuscript contain recognisable horse behaviour (e.g. flehmen, S25 and S30 Videos), when coding facial expressions it is important not to try and immediately assess the overall behaviour, but instead to focus on describing the individual facial movements. One of the key actions seen in flehmen (AU122, the upper lip curl) has also been recorded in some pain expressions of the horse [45, 46], and yet is also seen in other, unrelated contexts (see S31 Video). A potential application of EquiFACS would be to establish whether there are particular configurations of facial movements displayed alongside the upper lip curl (AU122), which help distinguish the different contexts. While recent work has suggested that horses use apparently complex facial expressions [28, 47], and that certain facial movements are associated with pain in domestic horses [2, 3], until now the full capacity of horse facial expressions to convey a range of information has been largely overlooked. In particular, no studies have yet investigated whether there are facial expressions associated with positive experiences in horses–a critical yet poorly understood aspect of animal welfare [48]. EquiFACS can be applied to address this gap, with the potential to greatly facilitate future studies of horse welfare as well as extending our knowledge of equine communication and cognition.

Test matches are played between national representative teams with ""Test status"", as determined by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The two teams of 11 players play a four-innings match, which may last up to five days (or longer in some historical cases). It is generally considered the most complete examination of teams' playing ability and endurance. The name ""Test"" stems from the long, gruelling match being a ""test"" of the relative strengths of the two sides.  - Jhelum (Urdu) is a city on the right bank of the Jhelum River, in the district of the same name in the north of Punjab province, Pakistan. Jhelum is known for providing a large number of soldiers to the British Army before independence and later to the Pakistan armed forces due to which it is also known as city of soldiers or land of martyrs and warriors. Jhelum is a few miles upstream from the site of the Battle of the Hydaspes between the armies of Alexander of Macedonia and Raja Porus.

On 11 February, one day after the conclusion of the match and three days after the riot, Harris wrote a letter to one of his friends about the disturbance. It was clear that he intended the letter to be printed in the press, and it appeared in full in The Daily Telegraph on 1 April, among other London newspapers, reigniting the furore. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack considered the incident of such significance that it reprinted the whole correspondence. The letter gives a detailed contemporary account of what Lord Harris thought about the riot.Lord Harris referred to the crowd as a ""howling mob"" and said ""I have seen no reason as yet to change my opinion of Coulthard's qualities, or to regret his engagement, in which opinion I am joined by the whole team"". He further added that ""Beyond slyly kicking me once or twice the mob behaved very well, their one cry being, 'Change your umpire'. And now for the cause of this disturbance, not unexpected, I may say, by us, for we have heard accounts of former matches played by English teams."" Harris further accused a New South Wales parliamentarian of assisting the gamblers in the inciting the unrest, although he did not name the accusee. He said I blame the NSW Eleven for not objecting to Coulthard before the match began, if they had reason to suppose him incompetent to fulfil his duties. I blame the members of the association (many, of course, must be excepted) for their discourtesy and uncricket like behaviour to their guests; and I blame the committee and others of the association for ever permitting betting, but this last does not, of course, apply to our match only.

The eastern half of the system merged into the Soo Line Railroad on January 1, 1986. The company went through several official names and faced bankruptcy several times in that period. The railroad no longer exists as a separate entity, but much of its trackage continues to be used by its successor and other roads, and is commemorated in buildings like the historic Milwaukee Road Depot in Minneapolis, Minnesota and in railroad hardware still maintained by railfans, such as the Milwaukee Road 261 steam locomotive.  - Wisconsin Central Ltd. is a railroad subsidiary of the Canadian National Railway.

It is also the successor to other Class I railroads, including the Minneapolis, Northfield and Southern Railway (acquired 1982) and Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road, acquired at bankruptcy in 1985). On the other hand, a large amount of mileage was spun off in 1987 to Wisconsin Central Ltd., now part of the Canadian National Railway. The Soo Line and the Delaware and Hudson Railway, the CP's other major subsidiary (before the 2008 DM&E acquisition), presently do business as the Canadian Pacific Railway, and most equipment has been repainted into the CP's scheme, but the U.S. Surface Transportation Board groups all CP's U.S. subsidiaries under the Soo Line name for reporting purposes.  - Thep Delaware and Hudson Railway is a railroad that operates in the northeastern United States that has been since 1991 owned and operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway under the rail subsidiary Soo Line Corporation also controls the Soo Line Railroad, Canadian Pacific Railway is owned by Canadian Pacific Railway Limited.  - Cisco is a place name for the remnants of a former unincorporated community located along the Soo Line Railroad and US 59 in the NW 1/4 of Section 11 of Badger Township , 149 North , Range 42 West , in Polk County , United States , approximately four miles north of the city of Erskine , and about the same distance south of the city of Brooks .

Javits Convention Center in New York City, and was televised for the 26th consecutive year on ESPN and ESPN2. The NFL draft had been held at Madison Square Garden since 1995, but was moved to the Javits Center in 2005. The draft featured the San Francisco 49ers selecting first overall Alex Smith from the University of Utah. compensatory selections were distributed amongst fourteen teams, with the Philadelphia Eagles and the St. Louis Rams garnering the most with four picks each.

It looks like the ladies man may have his eye on a new woman

SERIAL ladies man Shane Warne looks like he is poised to strike again… and this time on supermodel Emily Ratajkowski.

 he immediately showed his appreciation.

The picture is of the model showing off her tiny waist in just a t-shirt and pants and of course the naughty former cricketer had to click ‘like’.

 but that won’t stop the lusty fella giving it his best shot.

This isn’t the first time the 46-year-old has used social media to track a girl.

Twitter is definitely one of Shane’s favoured methods of communication and in May 2015 he was delighted after he was followed by famed porn star Jenna Jameson.

 tweeting her: “Thanks for the follow!

 hope all cool your way”.

 Rhian Sugden, a string of messages through Twitter.

Shane also struck up an unlikely friendship with then newly single 90210 star AnnaLynne McCord on Twitter.

He of course kicked things off by writing: “@IAMannalynnemcc Hope all good your way and you’re behaving this weekend hahaha…. See you soon !!!!! (sic)”

While AnnaLynne replied: “#Behaving ? Me? Hardly! See you soon” followed by a flirty kiss emoji.’

Last year Shane was the victim of a kiss and tell afte single mother Kim McGrath told Woman’s Day magazine that she went on two dates with the former cricketer.

 while he was in South Australia commentating on a test match, and Kim described him as one of the best lovers she’s ever encountered, saying Shane was “very strong in the bedroom”.

Shane’s last official relationship – with DJ and model Emily Scott – ended in September 2014 after just three months of dating.

 but she couldn’t tame the wild one and it was all over by 2014

"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.","Background: Irfan Khan Pathan ( pronunciation ; born 27 October 1984) is an Indian cricketer who plays all formats of the game. He made his debut for India in the 2003/04 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, and was a core member of the national team until a decline in form set in during 2006, forcing him out of the team. Since then, he has been in and out of the limited-overs teams (ODIs and T20Is), and has only sporadic appearances in Test cricket. Pathan played his last Test in April, 2008 at the age of 24.
 Pathan rose to get selected in the Under-14 Baroda cricket team, and when he was selected at Under-15 level to represent Baroda in a national tournament, he was finally presented with a full set of cricket equipment, having before been restricted to second-hand gear due to his family's limited economic means.  In December 1997, Pathan broke into the Baroda Under-16 team, less than two months after turning 13. He took a total of 1/35 and scored 1 and 11 against Gujarat and was dropped immediately afterwards. He did not play again for the Under-16s for two years, and in November 1999, less than a month after turning 15, he made his next appearance, this time for Baroda Under-19s against Maharashtra. He scored 61 and 9 and took a total of 3/41 in a victory, but was immediately dropped back to the Under-16s for the next match, and spent the rest of the 1999-2000 season there. He bowled short spells in the younger division, taking four wickets at 38.00 in six matches, averaging less than seven overs an innings. He had more success with the bat, scoring 253 runs at 31.62 including a best of 72 against Mumbai.  Pathan was then selected for the India Under-15 team in mid-2000 to play a series of matches against their colleagues from other countries. He took 15 wickets at 12.66 in ten matches, including a best of 3/2 against Thailand, and scored 15 runs at 7.50. India won all but one of the matches, most by enormous margins.

You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.,"There’s a story in my Tuscan family of nobility and forbidden love. It’s set in Taranto, Puglia, on Italy’s southern heel and involves my daughter’s great-great-grandmother. The best known version is told by my husband Marco’s uncle, Riccardo, who remembers it being told to him by his elderly Nonna Anna herself. Anna Michela Comasia Maria Calianno. Her long name was a sign of her family’s noble status. She was born in Taranto, Puglia, in 1889, into a wealthy, well-educated Tarantine family of physicians, surgeons and landowners. One day, by chance, young Anna answered the door instead of the butler. There was Nicola Cardellicchio, the postman. He came from a poor family of bricklayers and wool spinners, raised by a single mother. “He was no adonis,” noted Nonna Anna. Nicola was rather short and stocky, but she liked him immediately. She continued answering the door whenever the postman passed. When Anna’s mother, Girolama, noticed her daughter’s growing interest in the postman, she forbid her to see him again, threatening to disown her. So Anna did what any lovesick girl would do: she ran away, eloping with Nicola. The couple had nine children in Taranto — Mario, Marco’s grandfather was born in the middle of the First World War — but times were very hard, and they moved north to Torino to look for work. Nonna Anna was perhaps not an instinctive cook. I wondered whether she ever had the possibility to learn how to cook. Her grandchildren, Angela (my mother in law) and Riccardo, remember her only ever making lesso (boiled meat) and these polpette, which became variously known in the family as “sugo di nonna Anna” and, oddly, “amatriciana” (which is actually a different recipe, a chilli-spiked sauce of fried guanciale and tomato to coat pasta). But these polpette – plump meat balls, cooked slowly in tomato sauce, a very traditional dish from Puglia – were passed down to Anna’s daughter in law, Angela’s Tuscan mother, Lina, who made them so often for her own family that she in turn taught her daughter in law,... Why did Anna continue answering the door?  A. not enough information  B. Because Girolama threatened to disown her  C. Because she married Nicola  D. Because she liked Nicola

His father was a railway signalman of Irish extraction, and his mother worked as a weaver at Harrowby Mill. His father left the family 18 months after Lawton was born, and Elizabeth moved back into her parents' home in Bolton. Elizabeth's father, James Hugh ""Jim"" Riley, became Lawton's surrogate father.

 and though he struggled in this game he went on to become a regular Reserve team player by the age of 16. After a poor run of form from Cecil Smith, Lawton was selected ahead of Smith for the Second Division game against Doncaster Rovers at Turf Moor on 28 March 1936; aged 16 years and 174 days, this made him the youngest centre-forward ever to play in the Football League. Rovers centre-half Syd Bycroft, also making his league debut, marked Lawton out of the game, which ended in a 1-1 draw. Burnley had played poorly, though Lawton was praised for his ""keen and fearless"" performance by the Express & News newspaper. He retained his place for the following game, and scored two goals in a 3-1 victory over Swansea Town at Vetch Field. He picked up a groin strain in his third appearance which caused him to miss two fixtures, before he returned to the first team for the final four games of the 1935-36 season; he claimed three more goals to take his season tally to five goals from seven games.  Lawton continued to train his heading skills intensely in the summer of 1936, and also played cricket for Burnley Cricket Club as a batsman in the Lancashire League. He scored a six against both Learie Constantine and Amar Singh. He scored 369 runs in 15 completed innings for an average of 24.06.  He turned professional at Burnley at the age of 17 on wages of PS7 a week. His grandfather attempted to negotiate a PS500 signing-on fee on his behalf but was rebuffed after the club alerted Charles Sutcliffe, Secretary of the Football League, who informed them that any attempt to circumvent the league's maximum wage was illegal. Lawton scored in his first appearance since signing the contract after just 30 seconds, before going on to record a hat-trick in a 3-1 win over Tottenham Hotspur, scoring a goal with either foot and one with his head.

 answer the following question: Did anything else happen to him?"
"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.","Norman Clifford Louis O'Neill OAM (19 February 1937 - 3 March 2008) was a cricketer who played for New South Wales and Australia. A right-handed batsman known for his back foot strokeplay, O'Neill made his state debut aged 18, before progressing to Test selection aged 21 in late 1958. Early in his career, O'Neill was one of the foremost batsmen in the Australian team, scoring three Test centuries and topping the run scoring aggregates on a 1959-60 tour of the Indian subcontinent which helped Australia win its last Test and series on Pakistani soil for 39 years, as well as another series in India. His career peaked in 1960-61 when he scored 181 in the Tied Test against the West Indies, and at the end of the series, had a career average of 58.25.

 O'Neill was compared to Don Bradman upon his entry into Test cricket. At his best, he was a dynamic stroke maker who was a crowd favourite because of his ability to score at a high pace, in particular with his power off the back foot. He was noted for his nimble footwork, which he used to negate spin bowling; however this slowed in his later career as he put on weight. O'Neill particularly liked to sweep the slower bowlers. He often put too much emphasis on his right hand, allowing a large space between his hands on the bat handle, and then turning his right shoulder too square towards the bowler. The renowned English batsman and captain Wally Hammond said that O'Neill was the best all-round batsman he had seen since World War II. O'Neill's tall build, strength and good looks also drew comparison to his boyhood idol Keith Miller. Despite the comparisons to Bradman, O'Neill was much taller and broader, and was often impetuous whereas Bradman was known for his patience and lack of rashness. O'Neill was also criticised for hitting across the line early in his innings.  O'Neill was highly regarded for his style and entertainment values. Teammate Alan Davidson said ""once set he was the most exhilarating player you'd ever want to see--he was dynamite. He'd play attacking shots off balls other people would only think of defending. He had wonderful skill and technique. His shots off the back foot down the ground off fast bowlers--you can't really describe how good they were."" His captain for Australia and New South Wales, Richie Benaud said that he was ""one of the greatest entertainers we've had in Australian cricket"". O'Neill's style led the British writer EW Swanton to say ""the art of batting, he reminded us, was not dead, merely inexplicably dormant"" Wisden opined that ""A high innings by O'Neill is a thing of masterful beauty. His stroking is delectable, immense in its power.""  Later in his career, O'Neill became a nervous and superstitious batsman, particular at the start of an innings. He wrote ""batting is a lonely business"" in his 1964 autobiography Ins and Outs, opining that he sometimes found first-class cricket to be ""depressing and lonely"".  He was regarded as an excellent fieldsman at cover, with a powerful and accurate throw, described by Wisden as a ""dream throw"" honed from a junior career as a baseballer. He was named as utility player in the 1957 All Australian baseball team, and his ability was such that he was approached by Major League Baseball scouts. Before the retirement of Neil Harvey, he and O'Neill fielded in tandem in the covers and the pair were regarded as the finest fielding combination of the time.

 as opposed to someone who enjoyed Star Trek but was never a true devotee, I would surely have died and gone to heaven early on in my lunch with Patrick Stewart. Or, as a Trekkie might put it, I would have beamed up to the pleasure planet Risa, 90 light years from the Sol system, where the weather is always perfect, the beaches always immaculate, and love forever free.

 having spent sizeable chunks of his five decades in acting immersed in them. ""There are lots of similarities,"" he says.

 with a mischievous glint in his eye, Stewart leans his famously bald pate towards me, over our dishes of Cobb salad, and says: ""Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise, its continuing mission to seek out new life and new civilisations. To boldly go where no one has gone before."" ""You see! It has a poetic flow!"" he exclaims, before adding quickly: ""I swear to you, I haven't said those words for years and years and years. I wasn't sure I'd remember them."" (I don't have the heart to tell him that he has actually got it slightly wrong and forgotten an important clause of Star Trek mission – ""to explore strange new worlds"".)

 close to his New York home. When I turn up early I am ushered to ""Mr Stewart's regular table"", located discreetly at the back. Stewart sweeps in precisely at the allotted hour, dressed all in black and disguised only by a working man's flat cap. He shakes my hand firmly and looks me straight in the eye. Not for the only time in our encounter he makes me think of a military officer.The other possible explanation for Stewart's revival of Picard in front of an audience of one is that he seems to be in right royal good spirits. And why wouldn't he be? As he approaches his 74th birthday, he is firing on all cylinders. Far from showing any signs of engine fatigue, for the lad from Mirfield, West Yorkshire, life and work just seem to get better and better. In September he married his third wife, singer-songwriter Sunny Ozell, and they live in a converted carriage house in the heart of Park Slope, one of Brooklyn's most fashionable neighbourhoods. And he's just come off a critically acclaimed double run on Broadway of No Man's Land and Waiting for Godot with his bestie Ian McKellen, who officiated at their wedding.

 Days of Future Past; and Stewart also appears in an indie film called Match which premiered at the Tribeca film festival. If that's not enough, just as we're finishing up our salads, the news breaks that he is to star in a 20-episode series of half-hour TV comedies conceived by Family Guy's Seth MacFarlane. Did I omit to say that in the past 18 months he's erupted into a global Twitter phenomenon, with 1.2m followers? (A halloween Twitpic of him dressed as a red lobster lying in the bath was retweeted 40,000 times.)

 it's hard to know where to begin. Might as well launch straight in with the unlikely parallels between Star Trek, the vehicle that propelled him to fame, and his ongoing love affair with Shakespeare. A few weeks into shooting Star Trek: Next Generation Stewart had a eureka moment. He was sitting in the captain's chair in the bridge of the starship Enterprise when he suddenly saw himself back in his old milieu: ""I realised that the set actually represented very much an Elizabethan stage, with the main acting area in the centre front, a raised area at the back, two vomitoria entrances low down. It was classic.""

 Stewart already had an accomplished career behind him with the Royal Shakespeare Company, but was unknown in Hollywood when one of the Star Trek producers saw him at a Shakespeare workshop at UCLA. ""I'd never seen myself especially as a film or television actor, let alone sci-fi,"" says Stewart. ""I went to LA to do it after I was assured the six-year contract I signed would never be called upon to be met; I was convinced we wouldn't even make it through the first season."" Seven seasons, 178 episodes, four feature films and plenty of Spandex later, Stewart emerged, to his own astonishment, as a Hollywood superstar.

 the Ethan Hawkes and Denzel Washingtons may dabble with Broadway, but Patrick Stewart is one of a rare breed that can neither be called a film star or a stage actor – because he is both.

 that perhaps there's something to the classical British thespian training that he enjoyed that produces actors peculiarly equipped to excel across stage and screen. Stewart eagerly concurs. ""I absolutely believe that's what it is. It's a feeling for language, a feeling for drama that is something a little more than totally naturalistic. I use this word a lot: 'heightened'.""

 and to Peter Hall, John Barton and Trevor Nunn at whose feet he sat when he joined the RSC, in awe at ""their immense knowledge and experience of Shakespearean language. I never knew you could speak Shakespeare in a way that was totally spontaneous and poetic at the same time."" He likens himself to a Leeds United football player in Don Revie's day. ""He had trained those buggers so intensely throughout the week that at 3pm on a Saturday afternoon those 11 players would run on to the pitch totally liberated, free to do what they wanted to do, having done the work.""

 the other great straddler between theatre and franchise films is none other than Stewart's best friend, Ian McKellen. That the two knighted British actors have forged a deep friendship is abundantly clear from Stewart's effervescent Twitter feed. To mark their Broadway double-act last autumn they instigated the Twitter equivalent of a riot, taking selfies in iconic NYC places – the top of the Empire State Building, on the boardwalk in Coney Island – wearing Godot-esque bowler hats and looking more than a little deranged. What booms out of the photos is how much fun they are having in each other's company.

 the two thespian lions are allies both on and off the camera. In previous X-Men films, Stewart's character, Professor Charles Xavier, has been at loggerheads with McKellen's Magneto. The two characters are both mutants, but they occupy opposing political extremes. Xavier is the moderate negotiator who prefers talk over battle; Magneto is a fighter and revolutionary. But in Days of Future Past the two are thrown on to the same side by the common threat of enemy machines.

"" Stewart says. ""He is pushed into Magneto's camp and they become collaborators. We are dealing with machines and not human beings, so argument, persuasion, is no longer an option.""

 given that the 11th-hour final production work on the film means neither of us has yet seen it. But we can stick with the theme of persuasion versus force as it also runs through Stewart's second new film this spring, Match – an intimate, touching portrait set in Manhattan of a gay, dope-smoking, knitting, TV soap-watching and rather lonely classical ballet teacher called Tobi, who has an encounter with a married couple, strangers who as the narrative unfolds require him to confront the choices of his past. Stewart is stupendous, displaying a breathtaking range of emotional shades and dramatic tones. He is funny one minute, enraged the next, then cathartic and profoundly moving.

"" he says, referring to his relationship with his children, Daniel and Sophia, by his first wife Sheila Falconer. ""As my responsibilities in the theatre grew, I was gone from nine in the morning until midnight. I was an absentee father, largely, and there was a price to be paid for that down the road."" He actively channelled such emotional conflicts into conjuring up Tobi. ""Actors, we have this thing called a 'sense memory' which we draw on for particularly emotional moments. We have these things stored away in a vault and we can draw them out when we need to.""

 I suggest.

""That's right. That was part of my training at Bristol Old Vic theatre school. We were taught how to store emotions. It means no experience is ever wasted.""

 then his relationship with his own father must have filled the sense memory equivalent of the NSA's mass surveillance database in Utah. Alfred Stewart, a regimental sergeant major in the British army, was a troubled soul who, after retiring from the armed forces, suffered post traumatic stress disorder. At weekends it came bursting out in drunken assaults on his wife, Gladys.

 Tobi places himself physically between the married strangers, played by Matthew Lillard and Carla Gugino, acting as a human shield. ""Don't take another step! Not another step!"" Tobi bellows at the husband, who is poised to strike his wife. It's an astonishing moment. Stewart unleashes himself with such explosive charge that the whole cinema feels as though it is quaking.

 and of the haunting piece he wrote for the Guardian in 2009 in which he describes his father's domestic violence through his then child's eyes. ""I knew exactly when the shouting was done and a hand was about to be raised – I also knew exactly when to insert a small body between the fist and her face, a skill no child should ever learn."" It's the same incident, I remark. He pauses for a second, and then says only this: ""You reach a choice moment where you say, 'That's enough. I'm not going to be a spectator in this any more.'""

 who used to mock his son's fondness for theatre remorselessly, is that he's come to appreciate over the years how much he is in his father's debt in terms of his acting career. Take Picard and Xavier. Both of them stand for non-violence and peace and, as such, are arguably polar opposites to Alfred. But both of them are leaders, commanders –very much in Alfred's military mould.

"" he says. ""Because he would have approved of what I was doing and how I used the role. I mean, books have been written about Picard's command style. It's taught in the military academy!""

 Blunt Talk – the upcoming Seth MacFarlane comedy series that will be broadcast on Starz next year. Stewart will play Walter Blunt, a working-class lad from the north of England with a military background and a career in TV news who gets shipped off to LA to front a cable news programme called Blunt Talk.

 but you mustn't!"" Stewart says emphatically. ""When we meet Blunt his show is no longer doing well, the numbers are dreadful and his career is in crisis."" OK, now I am thinking Piers Morgan. Can't help it. ""He just keeps falling into these tailspins. One after another. It's completely realistic and truthful. This is not a gag show, it's not one-liners. It's single camera on film – we'll be making a half-hour movie every six days.""

 I say, he's not coming home to the UK any time soon. Stewart responds that he has a lovely house in Britain that he adores, and that he intends to spend as much time as possible in the mother country. But on this point he is resolute: ""I am a resident of the United States.""

 he says, started for the first time thinking seriously about taking up American citizenship. It's partly the recent marriage to Ozell and how embraced he feels by her family. And it's partly a sense of political frustration at not having a vote in America. ""It's long overdue,"" he says. ""There's only so much I can do, only so much I can comment on.""

 I ask Stewart whether he ever fears, in those dark hours, that all the cornucopia, the largesse, the riches of his life that seem to just keep on giving will one day dry up. ""I don't have those kind of dark hours, except where health is concerned,"" he says. ""I've had two major scares in the past 10 years – one with heart, one with cancer – both of them taken care of."" We both, in unison, start knocking on wood.

 as the waiter clears away our plates, Patrick Stewart launches into one final tale, this one about McKellen and how, as they waited for the curtain to go up for No Man's Land, they would moan and moan about their ailments. ""Nobody would believe it. Here were Magneto and Charles Xavier, these power-houses, griping about their aches and pains.""

 giants of the English stage, were sitting behind the curtain just before the start. ""Ian was telling me about his experience with catheters. The call came: ""We're going up!"" The curtain rose, the lights went on, and we were both chuckling about catheters. That made for a slightly different show.""

Taylor hit an unbeaten 131 off just 124 balls as the Kiwis smashed an incredible 100 runs off the final five overs of their innings. New Zealand looked set to post a modest total as they labored to 164-4 with ten overs remaining but fireworks from Taylor -- who hit seven sixes -- and Jacob Oram saw them amass 138 more runs. Finishing on 302-7 off their 50 overs the Kiwis shell shocked Pakistan, who contributed to their own downfall with sloppy fielding and poor bowling.

5 reasons not to skip La Paz

 Bolivia

 Bolivia

 Bolivia

 Bolivia

 Bolivia (CNN) -- It's easy to write off Bolivia's largest city as just another congested, chaotic Latin American metropolis.

 where they can explore the Andes, the Amazon basin and the world's largest salt lake in one visit, La Paz is their most likely point of entry. But to most, it's little more than that -- a place to spend a day or two sipping coca tea and adjust to life at 10,000 feet while planning adventures.

 a tangled maze of steep and winding streets. The cultural legacy of Bolivia's largest indigenous groups, the Quechua and Aymara, permeate the busy urban landscape, where vehicles compete with pedestrians and sidewalk vendors.

800 to 13,450 feet, ""the city that touches the sky"" has plenty of distinctions that come in handy in bar trivia: home of the world's highest international airport and highest seat of government. Its elevation also makes for extreme temperature: sunny, hot days and cold, windy nights. But a closer look reveals some unexpected surprises that aren't spelled out in tour guides.

 a noisy thoroughfare and a busy side street, Plaza San Francisco is not the prettiest public space La Paz has to offer, but it's a great place to people-watch.

 babies slung over their shoulders in colorful wraps, wait for buses alongside teens in skinny jeans and heavy eye makeup. Vendors in blue jumpsuits push around carts of ice cream which everyone seems to be eating.

 along with an opportunity to glimpse the city from the bell tower.

 owing to the polish of its refurbished structures. But in a busy metropolis that doesn't go out of its way to cater to tourists, it's a peaceful stretch of cobblestone and colorful buildings that brings to mind other colonial cities like Antigua, Guatemala, or Campeche, Mexico. Step inside one of the dimly-lit bars or restaurants and you'll find quiet courtyards shielded from the bustle of the city. The street is home to four museums in colonial homes, noteworthy for their architecture as much as their exhibits. Museo de Casa Murillo -- former home of Pedro Domingo Murillo, one of the martyrs of the La Paz Independence movement of July 16, 1809 -- features paintings, furniture and clothing from an era when La Paz was torn between loyalty to the Spanish viceroy and support for indigenous rights. At the Museo de Instrumentos Musicales, also a school and meeting place for aspiring musicians, visitors are likely to stumble upon a jam session of charango players or pan flutists. Students of the school often put on Saturday night performances, where you might catch a guitar duet performed by a 7-year-old prodigy and his Japanese instructor.

Museo Nacional de Etnografia y Folklore

 chances are you'll stumble on a parade or celebration where traditional Bolivian song and dance is the centerpiece (yet another reason to stick around La Paz on the weekend). The colorful costumes and masks, representative of dances from different regions and evocative of the film, ""Return to Oz,"" might leave the uninitiated wondering what the heck is going on. The Museo Nacional de Etnografia y Folklore offers some explanation for why horned devil masks and caricatures of African slaves figure prominently in folklore in an impressive display of masks and costumes. For extra trivia, check out the exhibit on the participation of transvestites in cultural celebrations of the late 20th century. Most Wednesdays, the museum keeps its doors open late for a show by the renowned Ballet Folklórico de La Paz, in which dancers decked out in full garb demonstrate customs from various regions, minus the drunken revelry of the street.

 Witches Market, Calles Sagarnaga and Linares

 exotic seeds, reams of multi-colored fabric, shoes and underwear, cell phone chips, kitchen accessories, a shoe shine, keys made by hand.

 which also offers charms and herbs that purport to prolong sexual encounters or attract secret crushes. Vendors down the street on Calle Linares down to Sagarnaga sell the traditional goods that tourists tend to look for in South America -- colorful hats and scarves made of alpaca and llama wool bearing images of alpacas and llamas, colorful rugs and textiles, jewelry with indigenous designs, all cheaper than you'll find similar items in Peru or Chile.

 tucked among the stalls of clothes and housekeeping products, foreigners can eat like a local at the same prices as a local, $1 to $2 on average. Eating in the street is not for everyone, especially those with sensitive stomachs, but it's worth for the risk for those willing to try. Bolivia is a meat and potatoes kind of country, with a knack for throwing fried eggs on the side and a few pieces of yucca if you're lucky. Women push around carts that double as kitchen counters from which they prepare full course meals, from lechon to empanadas to roasted pork sandwiches. At night, more roving carts appear, offering tripe or hamburgers and hot dogs and salchipapas (sausages and french fries). Fresh fruit juice stands are abundant, but should also be approached with caution. Cups of pear juice with a fuzzy pit resting at the bottom may remind you of the llama fetus at Witches Market, but drink it and you'll be treated to one of the sweetest drinks without artificial sweetener you'll ever try. Don't forget to suck on the pit when you're done!"

Iris is returning to Britain to marry a ""blue-blooded cheque chaser"", but an avalanche has blocked the railway line. The stranded passengers are forced to stay the night at the inn, including Charters and Caldicott, cricket enthusiasts who want to return to England to see the last days of the Test match. That evening, Iris complains about loud folk music coming from the room above her. She has the guilty musician, Gilbert Redman (Michael Redgrave), thrown out of his room, only to have him move into hers, forcing her to capitulate. Miss Froy (Dame May Whitty), a former governess and music teacher, listens to a tune performed by a folk singer under her window. Unseen by her, the singer is killed. The next morning, before catching the train, Iris is hit on the head by a planter apparently aimed at Miss Froy, who then helps Iris onto the train. Also on board are Charters and Caldicott, Gilbert, a lawyer named Todhunter and his mistress ""Mrs. Todhunter"". As a result of her injury, Iris blacks out. After the train is moving, Iris wakes up in a compartment with Miss Froy and several strangers. She joins Miss Froy in the dining car for tea. Unable to be heard above the train noise, the elderly lady writes her name on the window with her finger. Soon after, they return to their compartment, where Iris falls asleep. When Iris awakens, Miss Froy has vanished. The strangers in her compartment say they know nothing about an English lady. Even Todhunter in the next compartment, who spoke with Miss Froy earlier, pretends not to remember her. Iris searches, but cannot find her. She meets up with Gilbert, who agrees to help. Dr. Hartz (Paul Lukas), a brain surgeon, says Iris may be suffering from concussion-related hallucinations. Charters and Caldicott also claim not to remember Miss Froy,...

Cricket was shocked by the death of Australian batsman Phillip Hughes last year after he was struck behind the ear by a ball.
 in rugby league, rugby union and football, since then - some from head injuries and others from heart failure.
So is sport getting more dangerous?
 there has been no detailed data on the number or nature of sport injuries treated by GPs or in hospitals.
 according to figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre.
 so the total is likely to be much higher.
 professor of public health research at Barts and the London School of Medicine, says this has to change.
"" she says.
 and particularly concussion, have been well monitored. Last season, in a study of nearly 600 rugby players in England, 13% experienced concussion - the most common rugby injury for the past three years.
 concussion in rugby is now being taken seriously, but the risks are still there because of how the game is played.
 and they play a more aggressive form of rugby.
 making it more dangerous.
 there's no reason to think we are not seeing the same thing at those levels.""
 she advocates taking contact out of collision sports such as rugby and football.
 but she says ""all games have evolved over time and we just need to make it safer for children and prevent injuries from happening"".
Some sports are inherently more dangerous than others.
 American football, equestrian sport and sky diving are all more risky than tennis, badminton and athletics, but that doesn't stop people from doing them.
 more people are taking part in extreme sports such as base jumping and parachuting than ever before.
 lead sports physician for the English Institute of Sport, says there is a definite trend towards trying out new and ever more dangerous activities, even though people are not always trained or equipped for them.
 he suggests, it's one way of getting the adrenaline rush we all crave.
And adding lots of protective equipment isn't a solution to the increased danger.
 well-designed helmets but they don't stop concussion. Instead they use them as a weapon.""
He says professional rugby players who wear shoulder pads just end up tackling harder.
 most sporting bodies are aware of the risks faced by those who take part and try hard to protect them by amending the rules and introducing new policies on injuries.
 pushing the body harder and harder does make injuries more likely, but there will always be the risk of a freak accident or an undetected heart condition.
 which makes them feel more frequent.
 sport is attractive because there is some danger involved. Taking that away altogether would change it completely.
Dr Loosemore says removing the risk is dangerous in itself.
""Sport is a way of putting danger into lives in a controlled way. If you get in a certain position it hurts.
""Sports that allow you to show courage are a good thing too.
 but there is less chance of it happening if they play sport in the real world."""

The passengers cram into a small village hotel for the night. Among the hotel guests eager to return to England are two British gentlemen, Caldicott and Charters, who are worried about missing the upcoming cricket Test match. The only room left for them is the maid's room. Other Britons are Iris (Margaret Lockwood), a young woman of independent means who has spent a holiday with some friends, now returning home to be married, Miss Froy (May Whitty), an elderly lady who has worked some years abroad as a governess and music teacher, Gilbert (Michael Redgrave), a young musicologist who has been studying the folk songs of the region, and a secretive couple Mr. and Mrs. Todhunter (Cecil Parker and Linden Travers) who are having a clandestine affair. Folk dancers stomp loudly in Gilbert's room just above Iris, making it impossible for Miss Froy to properly hear a musician singing a haunting melody out in the street. Iris bribes the manager to throw Gilbert out of his room. Gilbert retaliates by barging into Iris's room and refusing to leave. Miss Froy seems to particularly enjoy the musician in the street below, and she throws a coin out her window. The music stops, as a murderous hand is seen to strangle the balladeer, but no one seems to notice anything wrong.The next morning, as the passengers are leaving the hotel to board the train, Miss Froy asks Iris for help in finding her luggage. They huddle around a pile of baggage, and just then a flowerpot is pushed off a window ledge from an upper floor. The pot appears meant for Miss Froy, but it knocks Iris on the head, instead. She says she is all right and gets on the train, but drops unconscious once aboard. When she recovers, she finds herself seated in a compartment across from Miss Froy, who has evidently helped her.

Dr. Gridlock

 Jan. 16, at 1 p.m. ET to address all your traffic and transit issues.

The Dr. Gridlock column receives hundreds of letters each month from motorists and transit riders throughout the Washington region. They ask questions and make complaints about getting around a region plagued with some of the worst traffic in the nation. The doctor diagnoses problems and tries to bring relief.

 Washington, D.C. 20071.

 travelers, let's get to your questions about getting around this region.

 D.C.: Why doesn't the Metro Web site sync with actual train schedules? I'm often leaving my office at Metro Center late and night, and I hate waiting 15 minutes for a train! So I figured I could look up when the next train was coming and be there to meet it. Except there is no relation to the Metro Web site and actual train schedules! Why???

 www.metroopensdoors.com, to get real time information on trains: From the home page, go to the ""Maps and Stations"" page and click on ""Find a Stop/Station."" You'll see a list of stations. Click on the on yours. Then click to ""Next Train Arrival"" to get the arrival times of the next three trains headed in each direction. What you'll see looks like the electronic display boards on the platforms. The page refreshes every 30 seconds.

 Va.: A big thank you to the Arlington County Police Officer who was pulling over people driving in the breakdown lane on 66-West this morning. This is a chronic problem in the a.m. between Lee Highway and Glebe Road, so it was nice to see someone take some action against it.

 especially at rush periods and especially inside the Beltway, where it's only two lanes. The state is looking at some improvements in the westbound direction that don't involve expanding the right of way. Driving in the breakdown lane is no solution. It's a dangerous thing for those who do it and for other motorists.

 Va.: This may be more of a Metro question but...

 only to find there is no parking (except for all the empty ""reserved"" spaces). Metro claims that a new parking deck is being built in 2007, but what do they plan to do about all the new traffic this will cause, and all the back-up this will cause on the trains?

 but construction is not keeping pace with demand. My letter-writers are particularly vexed about the closings of parking areas in some places to make way for construction around Metro stations. Vienna is a case in point. I talked to a group of retired federal workers in the Vienna-Oakton area last week who said they don't even think about taking the train. They like to do their traveling outside of rush hour, and of course, you can't get a parking space at the Vienna Station. Meanwhile, Metro wants to add more reserved parking and overbook it, like airlines overbook seats because they know some people won't show up. I hear from some people frustrated because they've been on the waiting list for reserved parking forever, but I also hear from others who see empty reserved spaces they can't use when everything else is full.

 Md.: Why isn't there a bullet train between Baltimore and Washington? Fifteen minutes station to station -- something really revolutionary and modern.

 you can read more about the proposal to build a maglev train line between Baltimore and Washington. But the thing is, this would cost about $4 billion to build (and I think the estimate would prove to be low). So what would a one-way ticket cost? Maybe $40? Maybe tourists would use it, or people in a desperate hurry on one particular day. But it's not a solution for commuters. We'd be better off extending Metro's Green Line up that way, building a new light rail line, or enhancing commuter bus service.

Can you please let us know the rules regarding bicycles on the escalators when the elevators are down?

I am always seeing strollers on the escalators and no one bats an eye...

 Metro Transit Police, or city/county police or fire officials. Cyclists shall allow other passengers to exit before placing bicycles in or taking bicycles out of the elevators."" Metro doesn't want to take a chance on a bike slipping from the riders hands and tumbling down the steps. It's crazy for people to take a chance with a stroller, too. Metro's Web site has a list of stations where the elevators are out of service, so surprises should be rare.

 Fla. (but recently D.C.): What do you mean by saying that Porcari ""knows"" that Maryland doesn't have enough money to build any new stuff? If they can afford the ICC, why can't they afford other stuff?

 for example. Probably would not include a $4 billion maglev link between Washington and Baltimore.

 but I have noticed some particularly foul odors in Metro stations recently. The odors smell part dead animal, or part burning brakes or some other mechanical piece burning. I notice the smells waiting in stations, but not on trains themselves. Sometimes the smell is enhanced when a train enters the station. Has anyone else noticed or commented on these odors?

 Metro says you're smelling the new brake pads. Metro knows the odor is a problem and is working with the manufacturer to fix this.

 Va.: Can you ask your readers how busy Chain Bridge Road from McLean through Tysons into Vienna is during rush hour? Is it busy throughout the day, or can I get across town better before a certain time in the early morning and early evening? As bad as it may be, is it better than taking the beltway to I66W to get to Vienna instead of Chain Bridge Road?

 Va.: When the funding finally gets finished for Metro to Tysons/Dulles, do you think we'll finally see movement on rail to Centreville down the median of I-66?

 which might be optimistic.

 Va.: Why do states constantly think that throwing money at a problem will solve it???

 all of the money in the world is not going to solve the traffic problem!

 we've got to spend a lot more money to help solve it. The problem is so big, it requires a big, complex solution. Make our transportation planning and construction problems more rational, more transparent, more efficient. Coordinate transportation planning and land use planning (like you said, more affordable housing near work centers). But if you just plan better for land use, you haven't solved the problem either. We still have to build roads and transit and sidewalks and bike paths to match up with a smarter design for our communities.

 Va.: Is there any information about how the closing of the Arlington Cemetery station this weekend went? I live in Rosslyn and I do know that the shuttle buses were there, but I decided not to bother to head to Pentagon City because of the business of going in and out of the Pentagon Station both ways, although I suppose riding down to L'Enfant Plaza and switching might have worked.

 the Yellow Line was extended and the Blue Line was diverted away from the Rosslyn tunnel.

 D.C.: The Montgomery County Planning Board recently approved recommendations to build a bikeway along the entire 18 mile ICC. Right now, the state is only going to build along 7.7 miles (non-contiguous). Did Porcari say anything about the bikeway (since he believes that ""a proper transportation network offers people choices -- drive, ride transit, bike, walk."")

 but I've got to believe that if he can find a way to extend it along the entire route, he'll do that. During the interview, Porcari frequently mentioned his enthusiasm for the region's bike trails and the need to use every opportunity to expand them. He noted with some pride -- because he was involved in the planning -- that the new Wilson Bridge will be accessible to bikers.

Chain Bridge into Vienna: Is a mess. Beltway is by far the better option.

 take the backroads from McLean to Rt 7 and hop on 66 there.

Dr. Gridlock: A response to the traveler's question above.

 Md.: ""Spending billions of dollars on transportation is NEVER going to solve the source or the problem: That people cannot afford to live where they work.""

 it wouldn't be what they wanted.

 but it's unrealistic to think we're going to eliminate the solo driver and get everyone living in areas dense enough to support transit.

What is the absolute latest I could leave the D.C. area to get to NYC relatively hassle-free? Is 1:00 pushing it?

 because there's no way to account for what's going to happen to you between here and there. Will the weather change? Will there be a lane-closing accident on I-95 in Delaware? How long will the backup be at Delaware's toll plaza? Also, when you're making a long-distance trip during daylight, you're likely to wander into somebody else's rush period in the congested Northeast corridor. A Delaware highway official pointed out to me that the stretch of I-95 through his state may seem like long-distance pavement to us in Washington, but it's Main Street for New Castle County. (You think I'm obsessing on Delaware?)

 D.C.: Re: trains to BWI. Why build a new train? Why extend Metro? There actually is a train that goes there from D.C. and New Carrollton already. The train is called MARC. Granted, the service is awful unless you are going southbound in the a.m. or northbound in the p.m. Oh, and forget about weekends and holidays. But expanding existing service of trains that go from Metro stops to BWI and Baltimore seems to be a lot cheaper than building new tracks or inventing mag-lev trains.

 state, city, feds together here) should recognize the existing commuter rail networks such as MARC and VRE as reasonable ways to transport large numbers of people around the area, not just a way to get people into D.C. for work. The model should be more along the lines of Long Island RR or NJ Transit, with frequent service even on the weekends, rather than simply 9-5 commuters.

 Porcari was asked if MARC service could run on weekends. Porcari noted that it would require renegotiation of agreements with the rail owners, plus a significant increase in the operating subsidy for MARC. Better equipment and more reliable service would be a good place to start improving MARC.

 Va.: Is there a resource online that displays what time the Metro stations with parking become full in the morning? Personally, I am interested in the Virginia stations. Thanks!

 though?

 Va.: Re:Chain Bridge Road

 assuming that everything is going smoothly. (No accidents, mistimed lights, random cop on the corner, etc.) But 123 into Vienna (after Old Courthouse) is usually a bear, primarily due to volume of both cars and traffic lights.

Dr. Gridlock: That's another response to reader question above on best route.

 D.C.: Any idea on what the ICC will be signed as when it's complete? Will it be an extension of I-370 or will it have a number at all?

 spokesman for the Maryland State Highway Administration, tells me that the intercounty connector will be designated as MD 200.

 D.C.: I used to work in McLean. I'd suggest that the reader seeking to go to Vienna consider taking the Toll Road west to Spring Hill, go left after the tollbooth, then right on Westpark Drive (the light at the top of the hill after passing the apartments), and follow that until you hit 123 next to the ""Toilet Bowl Building."" Then go right onto 123. This avoids the mall traffic. In my experience 123 was worst during the evening rush hour but was okay during midday, but that was a few years ago.

Dr. Gridlock: Another response to the travel question above. (What I've found is that our readers are an army of researchers and they're very willing to help fellow sufferers on the roads and rails. This is a very powerful force.)

 Va.: re: travel between D.C. and NYC -- I've tried, and there is no way to travel during the day and miss rush hour everywhere. If you are actually going to NYC (vs. the suburbs), you stand a chance if you leave D.C. around 9:30 a.m. If you're passing through D.C. to Long Island or Westchester, you'll hit rush hour on the other side of the city.

 and the later you leave, the better -- you'd be amazed how much traffic is still on the NJ Turnpike at midnight. I usually wait until 9 p.m. before I head out.

 in doing some columns of holiday travel advice, I came to the conclusion that the time you leave outweighs the importance of the route you take in most cases. If you're traveling in the Northeast corridor of during holiday periods, you'll get more benefit from a very early or very late departure than you will from a ""shortcut.""

 and start thinking of it as a piece of a vital commercial corridor that connects the entire eastern seaboard. A corridor that is consistently brought to a crashing halt in Delaware. Why don't they have high speed EZ-Pass lanes, similar to the N.J. turnpike, where you can drive through at 55 mph? That facility added to the Delaware Memorial Bridge and to the absurd little toll plaza they use to extort payment from all travelers would help immeasurably.

 like so many other turnpike and bridge authorities do. Must be a revenue reason. Probably something about the ease of getting around that toll plaza near the Maryland border.

 police officer..)

 next Tuesday Jan. 23, 7-8:30.

 Arlington, and I'll mention that in my Road Watch column as well. That meeting is about several ways the state has come up with to ease westbound travel without expanding the right of way on I-66 inside the Beltway.

 D.C.: Dr. Gridlock, I'm sure you've heard these comparisons before. I visited NYC a couple of weeks ago and couldn't help but marvel at how much more efficient the subway system is there. My sister was able to go online and figure out the best way for me to get from the city to Queens so that I could be picked up by my in-laws. Not only did it work, but it was a lot quicker than I expected -- on a Saturday!

 they are relatively clean and seemingly run like clockwork and quite frequently -- for a Saturday. I also noticed there is a flat rate and no turnstiles when exiting the station.

 do we trade off more luxurious trains and cleaner stations for trains that don't run frequently on weekends, evenings and holidays?

 there's New York and then there's everything else. Though it's a century old, the NYC system has lots of natural advantages. The region is so densely populated it can support an enormous transit system. Also, it was built with express tracks, that not only speed travel but also allow the subway managers to work the trains around problems. Still, our Metro system is one of the finest I've seen in my travels. We all want to see it get better, but that shouldn't blind us to this great resource. By the way, the ""Trip Planner"" on Metro's Web site is pretty good at helping you get around the region by transit. I use it a lot.

 Va.: Anyone want to do an actual headcount of Delaware tags on 95 IN Delaware? I worked there for several years and most folks avoid it like the combination of the plague and Ebola.

 we say ""never again"" after a bad drive on the Beltway or a crushing experience on the Orange Line. But the next day, we're back in the rut because we haven't found a better way.

 Va.: I have written with this question but have never seen it in your column. I commute to Herndon from Tysons on the Toll Road. Frequently, a Fairfax County bus exits the Dulles Access Road doing 65 or 70, then has to careen over four lanes of traffic in time to get off at its Toll Road exit. I see the same thing the other direction, as buses get onto the Toll Road then swoop to the left to get on the Access Road. This seems like an accident looking for a time to happen.

Why are buses allowed to use the Dulles Access Road? And why are they routed so as require such challenging lane changes?

 let alone a bus. That set up must have been designed for an era with far fewer cars trying to jam through. It is pretty common, though, to give buses access to the fastest possible route. They have access to the carpool lanes, they'll have access to the tolled intercounty connector in Maryland and to the High Occupancy/Toll lanes when they're built from Springfield to American Legion Bridge.



 two things I see every day:

 but blowing right through it

 even though there is a sign saying ""No Turn on Red from This Lane"". But really it's so small that people miss it, or people honk if someone actually stops on red in this lane.

 that is all.

Dr. Gridlock: Thought I'd share that vent with the group. ""Northern Virginia's"" frustrations are pretty common across the region.

 Md.: Commuter buses are only as good as the roads they travel. There are plenty of commuter buses coming up to D.C. from Southern Maryland each day, but they sit in the same horrific traffic on 5/301 and into D.C. that I do in my car. I would take the bus if there were dedicated lanes and a consistent schedule. Any talk from Porcari about those types of improvements (or any improvements for that matter) for the fast-growing Southern Maryland region?

 give the man a chance. He isn't even in Annapolis yet. But I can tell you this: When we were talking about improvements in Maryland's transportation system, Porcari talked specifically about the addition of commuter buses to serve Southern Maryland. We also talked a bit about the need for a Route 301 bypass around Waldorf. I think you've got a guy coming into this job who brings experience from his first round under Gov. Glendening and an awareness of what Maryland travelers are looking for in terms of improvements.

 I need to head off to a briefing on a transportation project many of you will be interested in. Once again, I've got far more good questions and comments on my screen than I could get to today. I'll make a printout and try to address some of them on the ""Get There"" blog or in upcoming Dr. Gridlock columns."
,"Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: Lewis is an aspiring 12-year-old inventor at an orphanage whose inventions have been scaring off potential parents. He decides that his mother, who abandoned him at the orphanage as an infant, is the only one who ever truly loved him and works on a machine to scan his memory to locate her. Taking his memory scanner to his school's science fair, Lewis meets 13-year-old Wilbur Robinson, a mysterious boy claiming to be a time cop from the future. Wilbur needs to recover a time machine that a man wearing a bowler hat has stolen. Lewis tries to demonstrate the scanner, but it falls apart, throwing the science fair into chaos. Upset, Lewis leaves while the Bowler Hat Guy, with the help of a robotic bowler hat named Doris, repairs and steals the scanner. Wilbur meets Lewis at the orphanage and asks him to repair the scanner. Lewis agrees to do so only if Wilbur can prove he is telling the truth, which Wilbur does by taking them to the year 2037 in a second time machine. When they arrive, however, Lewis says he can use the time machine instead of the scanner, and he and Wilbur get into an argument and crash. Wilbur then asks Lewis to fix the time machine, but Lewis has another condition: Wilbur has to take him to visit his mother afterwards. Reluctantly, Wilbur agrees and hides Lewis in the garage. Lewis doesn't stay there for long, however, and ends up meeting the rest of the Robinsons except for Cornelius, Wilbur's father, who is away on a business trip. Following Lewis, the Bowler Hat Guy and Doris unsuccessfully try to kidnap him. Meanwhile, the Robinsons offer to adopt Lewis, but change their mind when they learn that he's from the past. Wilbur admits to lying to Lewis about taking him back to see his mom, causing Lewis to run off in disgust. Lewis then discovers that Cornelius Robinson is, in fact, a future version of himself, and Wilbur is his future son. Lewis also finds out that the Bowler Hat Guy is a grown-up version of Lewis' roommate, Michael ""Goob"" Yagoobian. Because he was always kept awake by Lewis...

 light colors; dark day, dark colors."" On bright, sunny days and in clear water conditions, choose lures that are light in color and mimic natural patterns. On cloudy days and in dirty water conditions, choose darker lures and those with a non-natural coloration, preferably types that make noise or vibrate as they move through the water. A notable exception to this rule is the use of 2-toned plastic worms that feature a darker head color and a fluorescent pink or yellow tail color. Many anglers use plastic worms colored like this when fishing in cloudy water conditions. In general, choose smaller jigs and grubs when fishing for panfish (bluegill, sunfish, crappie, perch) and larger lures such as spinnerbaits and crankbaits when fishing for bigger fish (bass, walleye, and pike). Smaller lures are best suited for light and ultralight spinning and spincasting tackle (or fly rods in the case of dry and wet flies) with lines of 4 to 10-pound test (2 to 5 kg class), while larger lures are meant to be fished with medium to heavy action rods, spinning or baitcasting reels, and lines of 12 to 20-pound test (6 to 10 kg class) or better. (Lures used to fish for muskellunge, the largest member of the pike family, are decidedly larger than those used for bass, walleye, and northern pike, and often require the use of a wire leader because of the muskie's sharp teeth.) Lure size can also be dictated by weather conditions and how fish react to them. In early spring, or when cold front conditions clear the skies and cool the water to make fish lethargic, smaller lures are usually better choices than larger lures. (Lures used for ice fishing are exceptionally tiny, usually grub jigs or small spoons.) In high-wind conditions, you may need to use a larger lure simply to have enough resistance on the end of the line to keep the wind from bowing it so that you can't detect if fish are hitting the lure. Also try casting out a spinner and just keep casting and retrieving the lure."

 O'Neill made his state debut aged 18, before progressing to Test selection aged 21 in late 1958. Early in his career, O'Neill was one of the foremost batsmen in the Australian team, scoring three Test centuries and topping the run scoring aggregates on a 1959-60 tour of the Indian subcontinent which helped Australia win its last Test and series on Pakistani soil for 39 years, as well as another series in India. His career peaked in 1960-61 when he scored 181 in the Tied Test against the West Indies, and at the end of the series, had a career average of 58.25.

 O'Neill was compared to Don Bradman upon his entry into Test cricket. At his best, he was a dynamic stroke maker who was a crowd favourite because of his ability to score at a high pace, in particular with his power off the back foot. He was noted for his nimble footwork, which he used to negate spin bowling; however this slowed in his later career as he put on weight. O'Neill particularly liked to sweep the slower bowlers. He often put too much emphasis on his right hand, allowing a large space between his hands on the bat handle, and then turning his right shoulder too square towards the bowler. The renowned English batsman and captain Wally Hammond said that O'Neill was the best all-round batsman he had seen since World War II. O'Neill's tall build, strength and good looks also drew comparison to his boyhood idol Keith Miller. Despite the comparisons to Bradman, O'Neill was much taller and broader, and was often impetuous whereas Bradman was known for his patience and lack of rashness. O'Neill was also criticised for hitting across the line early in his innings.  O'Neill was highly regarded for his style and entertainment values. Teammate Alan Davidson said ""once set he was the most exhilarating player you'd ever want to see--he was dynamite. He'd play attacking shots off balls other people would only think of defending. He had wonderful skill and technique. His shots off the back foot down the ground off fast bowlers--you can't really describe how good they were."" His captain for Australia and New South Wales, Richie Benaud said that he was ""one of the greatest entertainers we've had in Australian cricket"". O'Neill's style led the British writer EW Swanton to say ""the art of batting, he reminded us, was not dead, merely inexplicably dormant"" Wisden opined that ""A high innings by O'Neill is a thing of masterful beauty. His stroking is delectable, immense in its power.""  Later in his career, O'Neill became a nervous and superstitious batsman, particular at the start of an innings. He wrote ""batting is a lonely business"" in his 1964 autobiography Ins and Outs, opining that he sometimes found first-class cricket to be ""depressing and lonely"".  He was regarded as an excellent fieldsman at cover, with a powerful and accurate throw, described by Wisden as a ""dream throw"" honed from a junior career as a baseballer. He was named as utility player in the 1957 All Australian baseball team, and his ability was such that he was approached by Major League Baseball scouts. Before the retirement of Neil Harvey, he and O'Neill fielded in tandem in the covers and the pair were regarded as the finest fielding combination of the time.

Its location in the city is fixed by the Amsterdam Treaty. The bank moved to new purpose-built headquarters in 2014 which were designed a Vienna-based architectural office named Coop Himmelbau. The building is approximately 180 metres (591 ft) tall and will be accompanied with other secondary buildings on a landscaped site on the site of the former wholesale market in the eastern part of Frankfurt am Main. The main construction began in October 2008, and it was expected that the building will become an architectural symbol for Europe. While it was designed to accommodate double the number of staff who operate in the former Eurotower, that building has been retained since the ECB took responsibility for banking supervision and more space was hence required.

Bradman's career Test batting average of 99.94 has been cited as the greatest achievement by any sportsman in any major sport. The story that the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore. Bradman's meteoric rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years.

 Lord Gowrie, persuaded Bradman to transfer to the army, a move that was criticised as a safer option for him. Given the rank of Lieutenant, he was posted to the Army School of Physical Training at Frankston, Victoria, to act as a divisional supervisor of physical training. The exertion of the job aggravated his chronic muscular problems, diagnosed as fibrositis. Surprisingly, in light of his batting prowess, a routine army test revealed that Bradman had poor eyesight.  Invalided out of service in June 1941, Bradman spent months recuperating, unable even to shave himself or comb his hair due to the extent of the muscular pain he suffered. He resumed stockbroking during 1942. In his biography of Bradman, Charles Williams expounded the theory that the physical problems were psychosomatic, induced by stress and possibly depression; Bradman read the book's manuscript and did not disagree. Had any cricket been played at this time, he would not have been available. Although he found some relief in 1945 when referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, Bradman permanently lost the feeling in the thumb and index finger of his (dominant) right hand.  In June 1945, Bradman faced a financial crisis when the firm of Harry Hodgetts collapsed due to fraud and embezzlement. Bradman moved quickly to set up his own business, utilising Hodgetts' client list and his old office in Grenfell Street, Adelaide. The fallout led to a prison term for Hodgetts, and left a stigma attached to Bradman's name in the city's business community for many years.  However, the SA Cricket Association had no hesitation in appointing Bradman as their delegate to the Board of Control in place of Hodgetts. Now working alongside some of the men he had battled in the 1930s, Bradman quickly became a leading light in the administration of the game. With the resumption of international cricket, he was once more appointed a Test selector, and played a major role in planning for post-war cricket.

 Urdu: nDmm lHq; born 3 March 1970), also known as Inzy, is a former Pakistani cricketer, and former captain. He is the leading run scorer for Pakistan in one-day internationals, and the third-highest run scorer for Pakistan in Test cricket. He was the captain of the Pakistan national cricket team from 2003-07 and is considered to be one of the best leaders in Pakistan Cricket history. Inzamam rose to fame in the semi-final of the 1992 Cricket World Cup.

 and made a good start to his career by scoring 20 and 60 runs in two matches against West Indies. This was followed by 48, 60, 101, and 117 runs against Sri Lanka.  Handpicked by former Pakistan captain Imran Khan for the 1992 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, 22-year-old Inzamam was relatively unheard of before the tournament. To the surprise of many he was persevered with throughout the tournament, coming in at various positions in the batting line-up, despite not being very successful early on. Yet it was his performances at the most crucial stage of the competition that made fans and summarisers take note. Inzamam rose to fame in Pakistan's dramatic semi-final against New Zealand at Auckland. With his side in a precarious position, chasing 262 against an impressive New Zealand side, he hit a fiery 60 run innings from just 37 balls to rescue his side and guide them into the final. The innings was regarded as one of the finest World Cup performances. He hit a massive six in that match which was described by David Lloyd as the shot of the tournament.  Inzamam made an equally vital contribution in the final of the World Cup, scoring 42 runs off just 35 balls, helping Pakistan reach a score of 249 after a sluggish start. These innings established Inzamam's billing as a big-game player, although he was unable to replicate his World Cup success in later tournaments.  Inzamam regard his best least highlighted innings of 90 not out against West Indies when Pakistan won their first ODI in the West Indies on 27 March 1993.  In total, Inzamam set a record for scoring the most half centuries in One Day Internationals, 83 - though this is now surpassed by Sachin Tendulkar, Jacques Kallis and Kumar Sangakkara. He also became the second batsman to score 10,000 runs in One-day Internationals (again after Tendulkar) and was named in the ICC World XI for both Tests and One-day Internationals in the 2005 ICC Awards. In his final ODI for Pakistan, playing against Zimbabwe in the 2007 Cricket World Cup, he took three catches whilst fielding, including the last one of the match, ending his One Day career."

 airing in 1998. It became famous for a segment, involving then host of tabloid current affairs TV show A Current Affair, where Safran harassed him in the style characteristic of A Current Affair by sorting through his bin, which was later satirised by comedian Shaun Micallef. Ray Martin had set-up members of the Paxton family. Safran and one of the victims, Shane Paxton, turned up to Ray Martin's home. Martin and his wife Dianne physically threatened Safran. Martin's wife ripped apart Safran's Papier Mache hat and Ray grabbed Safran by the collar, prompting Shane Paxton to intervene. Martin was in contact with the ABC and specifically warned Safran in the segment that he's spoken to Roger Grant the then Head of Corporate Affairs at the ABC. Martin's connection with this executive at the ABC is suspected to be a reason the series never made it to air. The Ray Martin segment was later played on Media Watch, John Safran: The Lost Pilot and on Youtube. In 2014, Martin still appeared bitter about the incident, calling Safran a ""serial pest"".  The second pilot was titled John Safran: Master Chef. This pilot focused on the food industry. Notably it featured a cooking segment where Safran prepared a beef dish. The twist comes when he arrives in an abattoir and shows detailed footage of cows being slaughtered to complete the dish. Though all unsuccessful, the pilots became hits via the Internet among university students. Safran also recorded a parody of Baz Luhrmann's song ""Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)"" entitled ""Not the Sunscreen Song"" which includes lines such as ""Never live in Adelaide, it's a hole"" and ""Remember, you can't get pregnant the first time you have sex"". It peaked at No. 20 in 1998 and was nominated for an ARIA. In Triple M's 2005 Greatest Songs Ever Written and Performed Since the Beginning of Time poll, ""Not the Sunscreen Song"" came in at #706 - one spot above ""Superstition"" by Stevie Wonder.  Safran also presented segments for the Seven Network's now defunct Late Report, some were also screened in the United Kingdom with Channel 4's Disinformation program. Safran attained police attention for a stunt to try and coerce cricketer Shane Warne into breaking a ""no smoking"" clause in an advertising contract with a nicotine gum manufacturer. Safran drove a remote controlled seagull with a cigarette onto the MCG pitch during a match. He was arrested for ""pitch invasion"", but the charges were dropped.

The NSWCA appealed to Lord Harris, and in reply he said he did not blame them or the cricketers of Sydney in any way, but said that ""it [the riot] was an occurrence it was impossible he could forget"". On 11 February, one day after the conclusion of the match and three days after the riot, Harris wrote a letter to one of his friends about the disturbance. It was clear that he intended the letter to be printed in the press, and it appeared in full in The Daily Telegraph on 1 April, among other London newspapers, reigniting the furore. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack considered the incident of such significance that it reprinted the whole correspondence. The letter gives a detailed contemporary account of what Lord Harris thought about the riot.Lord Harris referred to the crowd as a ""howling mob"" and said ""I have seen no reason as yet to change my opinion of Coulthard's qualities, or to regret his engagement, in which opinion I am joined by the whole team"". He further added that ""Beyond slyly kicking me once or twice the mob behaved very well, their one cry being, 'Change your umpire'. And now for the cause of this disturbance, not unexpected, I may say, by us, for we have heard accounts of former matches played by English teams.""

He said I blame the NSW Eleven for not objecting to Coulthard before the match began, if they had reason to suppose him incompetent to fulfil his duties.

Folk dancers stomp loudly in Gilbert's room just above Iris, making it impossible for Miss Froy to properly hear a musician singing a haunting melody out in the street. Iris bribes the manager to throw Gilbert out of his room. Gilbert retaliates by barging into Iris's room and refusing to leave.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps.,"Sydney Francis Barnes (19 April 1873 - 26 December 1967) was an English professional cricketer who is generally regarded as one of the greatest ever bowlers. He was right-handed and bowled at a pace that varied from medium to fast-medium with the ability to make the ball both swing and break from off or leg. He is the quickest bowler to achieve 150 Test wickets in history. Barnes was unusual in that, despite a very long career as a top-class player, he spent little more than two seasons in first-class cricket, representing Warwickshire and Lancashire.

 he joined Smethwick Cricket Club and played for its third team. He was taught to bowl off spin by Billy Bird, the Smethwick professional who had played for Warwickshire, and then taught himself to bowl leg spin. In due course, he was selected for the second team and had earned a place in the first team, playing in the Birmingham and District Premier League, at the start of the 1893 season.  In 1894, when Barnes was a 21-year-old fast bowler, he was asked to join the ground staff of Staffordshire County Cricket Club but he found the terms unattractive. Instead, he joined Rishton Cricket Club in the Lancashire League where the pay was better than in any form of county cricket, largely because of match bonuses and collections. Wilfrid S. White commented that Barnes' career in league cricket ""stands out unparalleled, unapproached, by any other player"".  Later in the 1894 season, Barnes was invited to play for Warwickshire, who were due to enter the County Championship in 1895. His debut was in a minor match against Cheshire at Edgbaston on 20-21 August. Barnes bowled only 8 overs, taking none for 27, and the match was drawn. On 23 August, Barnes made his first-class debut for Warwickshire against Gloucestershire at Clifton College Close Ground, except that he did not take the field as play was restricted by bad weather to just 72 overs of his team's first innings, in which they reached 102-2.

 especially with the new ball.
There was pressure on; the light was not great; England couldn't win the game; they were batting to save the game - all the usual issues.
You might think that England should have fared a bit better but the new ball is difficult.
It's very awkward as a batsman when the ball lands in the same place on separate occasions and does completely different things.
 and when you've got about half a second to react and in your mind you're wondering what the pitch is going to do, that creates uncertainty.
Top batsmen have to deal with these situations but it is so much easier said than done.
Alex Hales got one that kept a bit low but it was another failure.
He has had four games and scored 136 runs. My view has not changed: any opening bowler would reckon Hales gives you more chance than he should as an opening batsman.
 and they are running out of options as to who to turn to with eight opening batsmen tried since Andrew Strauss retired in 2012.
 either opening or at number three, and he played a loose shot to be the third England wicket to fall inside the opening 10 overs.
 but they have got to sort the opening position out.
 Hales might well score some runs and it might just be that one score that gets his Test career under way. But he just has these technical issues that have been talked about time and again.
He has got one score of 60 but the other innings he hasn't got going and it will be the manner of the dismissals that will disappoint him.
 Compton and James Taylor all know their places are under the microscope.
Discarded players such as Gary Ballance and Ian Bell will be thinking that if they start the domestic season well they could force their way back into the team.
All of these players will feature in county cricket and will have a few games early-season. They will have to get out there and battle to earn selection.
It is no bad thing in a way; you want competition for places and you want it to be tough but I don't think any of them will be sleeping particularly easily before the selection for the first Test match against the Sri Lankans at Headingley on 19 May.
 though. It seems as though they have moved on after he was part of the 2-0 defeat against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates late last year.
 but he has got to earn it.
 South Africa are ironically now enjoying some players in excellent form, so they have a great deal of hope for the future.
Hashim Amla played beautifully again. It was a very brave innings after being hit a few times on the thumb and it was a shame he didn't get his second hundred in the match
 who made that wonderful hundred in Cape Town, continues to impress everybody.
 he moves his feet really well, technically he looks good and he has been a revelation, as has the young fast bowler Kagiso Rabada. He took two more wickets to tear through the England top order in that short session before the close.
They both came with promise but have really shown they can have really successful Test careers.
 who wants one more wicket to become the youngest South African to take 10 in a Test match.
 getting his seven wickets in the first innings haul of 7-112, but he certainly seemed to be moving OK.
 and he and Morne Morkel will be quite a handful.
Clearly South Africa will be very strong favourites to wrap it up on the final day.
I was a bit surprised how long they batted on. I thought they would have got to a 270 lead and really push on and play more shots.
Had they declared earlier they could have had England batting before the storm arrived and tested them in some very dark conditions.
 but the general view is they could gave declared an hour earlier.
 they've got lots of time left and they have the second new ball, which is perfectly timed after 60 overs on Tuesday to wrap it up if they haven't already done so.

Music Review - Allan Harris Performs at the Metropolitan Room - NYTimes.com

 a baritone crooner with a husky edge, may be Nat King Cole and his trio. But to describe this pop-jazz singer, composer and guitarist as a gifted Cole acolyte doesn’t take into account the winding tributaries that bring in the blues, folk, pop-soul, light funk, Americana and Broadway flavors. Together they flow into a fertile musical delta that reflects Mr. Harris’s unfashionably hopeful vision of multicultural America.

 “Just Me,” that explores all those tributaries. It began conventionally enough with “On the Street Where You Live,” the stentorian Lerner and Loewe standard from “My Fair Lady,” reinvented by Mr. Harris and his band (Dan Kaufman on piano, Paul Beaudry on bass and Jerome Jennings on drums) as an intimate, medium-light swinger.

 “When Will the Bells Ring For Me?” (a Tony Bennett signature song, usually done by Mr. Bennett with grand emotional flourishes) and the Cole hit “Too Young” were heated up and served with the same home-cooked affability.

 the starchy “Bring Him Home” (from “Les Misérables”) yielded the most surprises, as Mr. Harris used the various layers of his voice to convey the tension of a desperate man holding back tears.

” a theatrical song cycle about a runaway slave named Blue who flees to Texas in the 1860s to become one of the first black cowboys. As the rougher edges of Mr. Harris’s voice came to the fore, he slipped into the persona of an itinerant folk-blues yarn spinner. His special guest, the jazz violinist Alan Grubner, supplied a thread of wild, antic fiddling. At one point Mr. Harris’s scrubby guitar evoked a softened Bo Diddley sound that seemed miles away from the unfailingly suave Cole. But was it really?

 even the one titled “Blue Was Angry,” isn’t bitter or hard-bitten. You never had the sense of listening to a troubadour who had traveled thousands of miles on foot over dirt roads. It was the voice of a benign storyteller, a deeply romantic true believer with a heroic vision of American history and the African-American contribution.

” a hymn to American unity and cooperation as stalwartly upbeat as “The House I Live In,” Frank Sinatra’s ode to harmony in diversity. In Mr. Harris’s music, the dream lives on.

The nuclear war which contaminated the northern hemisphere was preceded by a standoff between the United States and China after the latter blockaded and later invaded Taiwan. Both countries are destroyed, as is most of the world. The submarine crew finds refuge in Melbourne, Australia, which the radioactive fallout has not yet reached (though radio communications with several radio operators farther north than Australia indicate that radiation has reached their countries and will be in Australia in a few months). Towers places his vessel under the command of the Royal Australian Navy and is summoned to attend a briefing. When Towers (Armand Assante), Australian scientist Julian Osborne (Bryan Brown) and Australian liaison officer Peter Holmes (Grant Bowler) find out there is an automated digital broadcast coming from Alaska in the Northern Hemisphere, the submarine is sent to investigate.

You must generate a detailed and long answer.,"Hugh Trumble (12 May 1867 - 14 August 1938) was an Australian cricketer who played 32 Test matches as a bowling all-rounder between 1890 and 1904. He captained the Australian team in two Tests, winning both. Trumble took 141 wickets in Test cricket--a world record at the time of his retirement--at an average of 21.78 runs per wicket. He is one of only four bowlers to twice take a hat-trick in Test cricket.

 Trumble endured a period where he was not able to take wickets consistently. With selection of the Australian team to tour England in 1890 due at this time, Trumble was anxious about this poor run of form. Noting his anxiety while playing, a friend offered him a beer during the lunch break to revive his spirits. Previously a teetotaler, Trumble enjoyed his first taste and ordered another before re-entering the field of play. Feeling relaxed, although wondering about his steadiness of step, Trumble took a succession of wickets to ensure his selection in the Australian team. Trumble finished the season with 27 wickets at an average of 14.20 per wicket.  The 1890 Australian team touring England was relatively inexperienced. The team missed the all-round ability of George Giffen, who had refused to join the squad, thinking it unlikely the tour would be a sporting or financial success. The Australians won 13 matches on tour, losing 16 and drawing 9. Trumble made his Test cricket debut in the First Test against the English team at Lord's Cricket Ground. He took only one wicket, dismissing Bobby Peel caught and bowled for 1. Batting at number eleven in the first innings he made 1 not out and in the second, 5 runs batting at number ten. Despite this lack of success, he retained his spot in the team for the Second Test at The Oval where he failed to take a wicket. He was selected for the Third Test at Old Trafford but continuous rain saw the match abandoned without a ball being bowled. Trumble played 28 first-class matches during the tour, scoring 288 runs at an average of 8.47 and took 52 wickets at an average of 21.75. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack wrote, ""Reports from Australia had led us to expect a great deal of ... Trumble"" but his ""straightness and regular length [were] insufficient to compensate for an obvious lack of 'devil' and variety"".  Trumble was not selected for the Australian team to play Lord Sheffield's touring English team in 1891-92. He did not return to the Australian team until his selection in the squad to tour England in 1893. Before the Test matches he took 14 wickets for 116 runs (14/116) against the Players followed by 12/84 against Kent at Gravesend. He played in all three Test matches in 1893, taking 6 wickets at an average of 39.00. Trumble scored 58 runs in the Tests with a highest score of 35 but had more success in the other matches, scoring 774 runs, including one century in all first-class matches on tour. Wisden noted that ""An immense improvement on his form of three years before was shown by Hugh Trumble, who bowled consistently well all through the tour"" and ""... the reports of Hugh Trumble's improvement in batting were amply borne out, his hitting in many matches being remarkably fine"".  When Andrew Stoddart's English team visited Australia in 1894-95, Trumble played only one Test, the Second at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In the first innings, England scored 75 runs with Trumble taking 3 wickets. England fought back in their second innings, scoring 475 runs to win the Test by 94 runs; Trumble failed to take a wicket.

 the team's vice-captain then, was promoted as the new Indian team captain and Dravid was appointed as his deputy.  The newly appointed vice-captain had moderate success in the bilateral ODI series against South Africa. Dravid scored 208 runs in 5 matches at an average of 41.60 including 2 fifties. He also took 3 wickets in the series including two wickets in a single over in the First ODI at Kochi. His bowling figures of 2/43 in 9 overs remained his career best ODI bowling figures. It was also the best bowling figure by any bowler for that particular match. His series bowling average of 22.66 was the best amongst all the bowlers in the series. India won the series 3-2.  India played a tri-nation series in Sharjah immediately after the bilateral ODI series against South Africa. Indian team performed poorly and failed to qualify for the Finals. Collective failure of Indian batting in the series can be judged from the fact that Dravid, with a poor show of 89 runs from 4 matches at an average of 22.25, was still the 2nd best Indian batsman in the series.

 the latest in a string of signs that the economic recovery is faltering.And with Europe, China and other nations taking steps to bolster their struggling economies in the face of a global slowdown, Washington and Wall Street expect the Fed to unveil plans for a third round of its controversial bond-buying program when the meeting ends Thursday.Economists said the move could help boost the economy if the Fed focuses its efforts on the slowly improving housing market. By buying mortgage-backed securities, it could edge down already historically low borrowing rates.Lower rates also could make banks more likely to lend because it would be easier to sell the loans to the Fed and avoid risks of losses. That, in turn, could help stimulate economic activity and help create jobs.""There's a bigger bang for the dollar when you're hitting a market that's already showing signs of healing,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist with Mesirow Financial.Given expectations of some action, the Fed could trigger a market sell-off if it opts to do nothing.""It would be a pretty big disappointment if the Fed did not act at this stage of the game,"" Swonk said. ""The employment report was the game changer.""There are downsides to another round of so-called quantitative easing.Lower interest rates hit elderly Americans hard by reducing the income they could draw from their savings, particularly certificates of deposit.""It's badly pinching seniors who rely on CDs,"" said James Chessen, executive vice president of the American Bankers Assn., an industry trade group.And those low rates, which the Fed has promised to extend at least through 2014, could be keeping businesses from borrowing now because they know they'll have access to cheap money for a long time.The previous two rounds of bond buying have caused the Fed's balance sheet to more than triple to $2.8 trillion over the last four years, angering Republicans and fueling a conservative movement to dismantle the central bank.Launching a stimulus program in the weeks before a presidential election also could lead Congress to take steps to rein in the Fed's authority, said Gregory D. Hess, an economics professor at Claremont McKenna College.A new round of bond buying could be ""another shovel full of dirt as the Fed digs its own grave as a politically independent institution,"" he said.But with the economy still struggling to create jobs, Bernanke and other Fed officials have signaled that they're ready to act. And though short-term interest rates are near zero, another large-scale bond-buying effort would be the central bank's main weapon.After the government reported last week that the economy added just 96,000 jobs in August, economists polled by Reuters said there was a 60% chance the Fed would launch another round of bond buying.The first round, from March 2009 to March 2010, involved the purchase of $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities, along with $200 billion in debt issued by government-backed agencies such as Fannie Mae and $300 billion in longer-term Treasury securities.With the economy still struggling in November 2010, the Fed launched a second round of quantitative easing, purchasing $600 billion in Treasury securities through June 2011. ||||| WASHINGTON — In September 1992, the Federal Reserve culminated a long-running effort to stimulate the sluggish economy by cutting its benchmark interest rate to 3 percent, the lowest level it had reached in almost three decades. 
  
 but it was not enough to change the course of the presidential election. Years later, Mr. Bush told an interviewer that the Fed’s chairman, Alan Greenspan, had cost him a second term by failing to act more quickly and more forcefully. 
  
” Mr. Bush said. 
  
 the Federal Reserve is poised to announce that it will once again seek to stimulate the economy in the middle of a presidential election season. 
  
 Fed officials insist that they do not consider politics in setting policy. But the imminence of the election makes it inevitable that the decisions reached by the Fed’s policy-making committee will be judged through a political lens. 
  
 and are seeking to impose new limits on its management of monetary policy. Some Democrats now echo Mr. Bush’s lament that new actions are too little, too late. 
  
 a Fed governor from 2006 to 2009, said the Fed’s current chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has concluded that the best defense of the Fed’s independence is to demonstrate its value by reaching decisions on the economic merits, then offering clear explanations to politicians and the public. “Any decision the Fed will make will make someone unhappy, but what you want out of an independent agency is a careful deliberative process,” said Mr. Kroszner, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. 
  
 that’s the best way to maintain the Fed’s independence,” he added. 
  
 and that the Fed still has the means to stimulate growth. Officials also are concerned about the combination of federal tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to take effect next year. 
  
 Moody’s Investors Service reiterated Tuesday that it could downgrade federal debt if Congress did not reach a debt reduction deal. Interest rates on federal debt remain near record lows despite a downgrade last year by Standard & Poor’s, but a second downgrade could force some investors to reduce their holdings of Treasury securities. 
  
 Wyo. The central bank could announce a new round of asset purchases, expanding its balance sheet for the third time since 2008. It also could announce its intent to keep its benchmark interest rate near zero beyond late 2014. Both are methods of reducing long-term interest rates, and encourage borrowing and riskier investments. 
  
 history offers evidence to the contrary. 
  
 dating back to 1952. During the last presidential election, the Fed slashed interest rates repeatedly as it responded to the financial crisis. In 2004, the Fed raised rates in June, August and September. 
  
” Credit Suisse said in a research note reviewing that history. 
  
 The decisions have always been subject to political pressure. The central bank’s independence was never intended to be complete. The Fed’s governors are appointed by the president. Its chairman has lunch regularly with the Treasury secretary and meets occasionally with the president. Congress dictates the Fed’s mission and requires it to report regularly on its actions. 
  
 then-chairman William McChesney Martin Jr. told Congress in 1957, “should be independent — not independent of government, but independent within the structure of government.” That meant, he said, having the freedom necessary to decide how best to meet the goals of national economic policy. 
  
 President Richard Nixon said at the swearing-in ceremony, “I respect his independence. However, I hope that independently he will conclude that my views are the ones that should be followed.” 
  
 Mr. Nixon pressured Mr. Burns to help the economy by printing vast amounts of money, contributing to an era of crippling inflation. 
  
 Paul A. Volcker and his successor, Mr. Greenspan, successfully established the benefits of independent monetary policy in reducing the rate of inflation, giving the Fed more leverage to resist White House pressure. 
  
 presidents and their advisers gradually stopped talking in public about monetary policy, concluding that it was counterproductive because the Fed was then forced to respond by demonstrating its independence. 
  
 then White House chief of staff, said publicly in 1995 that the Fed should cooperate with efforts to revive the economy, his comments were quickly disavowed. But the Clinton administration privately pushed Mr. Greenspan to stimulate growth ahead of the 1996 election and rewarded those efforts by nominating Mr. Greenspan for a new term. 
  
 and most recently met with the president at the end of May, although he continues to meet regularly with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. Even Congressional Democrats have generally avoided public calls for the central bank to take new action. 
  
 the Republican Party’s presidential nominee, has pledged to replace Mr. Bernanke. But in recent weeks Mr. Romney also has seemed to take a more measured tone in his remarks. He told Fox News last week that he doubted the benefits of any new Fed policies. 
  
” Mr. Romney said. 
  
 Mr. Bernanke has simply repeated the Fed’s long-standing mantra that it does not listen to politicians nor think about politics. 
  
” Mr. Bernanke said earlier this year. “We’re not paying any attention to election calendars or political debates. We’re looking at the economy.” ||||| If the world's investors are right, the Federal Reserve is about to take a bold new step to try to invigorate the U.S. economy. 
  
"" or QE. 
  
 Others foresee a more measured response when the Fed ends a two-day policy meeting Thursday. They think it will extend its timetable for any rise in record-low short-term rates beyond the current target of late 2014 at the earliest. 
  
 On one point few disagree: The Fed feels driven to act now because the U.S. economy is still growing too slowly to reduce high unemployment. The unemployment rate has topped 8 percent every month since the Great Recession officially ended more than three years ago. 
  
 job growth slowed sharply. The unemployment rate did fall to 8.1 percent from 8.3 percent. But that was because many Americans stopped looking for work, so they were no longer counted as unemployed. 
  
 Wyoming, late last month. Bernanke argued that QE and other unorthodox Fed actions had helped ease borrowing costs and boosted stock prices. 
  
 Higher stock prices increase Americans' wealth and confidence and typically lead individuals and businesses to spend more. 
  
 Bernanke cited research showing that the two previous rounds of QE had created 2 million jobs and accelerated economic growth. Still, he said persistently weak hiring remains ""a grave concern"" that inflicts ""enormous suffering."" 
  
 His remarks sent a clear signal that the Fed will do more. 
  
"" said David Jones, chief economist at DMJ Advisors. ""I think he is convinced that there is a need to do something."" 
  
 inside and outside the Fed, remain opposed to further bond buying. They fear that by pumping so much cash into the financial system, the Fed is raising the risk of high inflation in the future. And many don't think more bond purchases would help anyway because interest rates are already near record lows. 
  
 the ECB announced a plan to buy unlimited amounts of government bonds to help lower borrowing costs for countries struggling with debts. 
  
 the U.S. economy could benefit, too. Europe's financial crisis and recession have slowed the U.S. economy, in part by reducing European purchases of U.S. goods. 
  
 the Fed bought more than $2 trillion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. 
  
 and enlarging its balance sheet will make it even more of one,"" argues Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Morgan Stanley and a former top economist at the Fed. Reinhart thinks the Fed will prefer to wait until at least December before announcing more bond buying. 
  
 he says, the Fed will have reviewed more employment data. The effect of Europe's debt crisis on the U.S. economy will be better known. And Congress' plans for addressing a U.S. fiscal crisis at year's end will be clearer. Without a budget deal, higher taxes and deep spending cuts will kick in next year. 
  
 many analysts think it would push its target date to mid-2015. The goal would be to lower borrowing rates by assuring investors that short-term rates will likely stay near zero even longer than previously thought. 
  
 and his defense of Fed bond purchases so strong, that many economists suspect a bond-buying program will be unveiled Thursday. 
  
 they've boosted the Dow Jones industrial average nearly 2 percent in September, a month that's typically weak for stocks. On Tuesday, the Dow rose 69 points. And Treasury yields have dropped on expectations that a new Fed bond-purchase program would lower interest rates. 
  
"" according to minutes of the meeting. 
  
 Friday's report that U.S. employers cut back sharply on hiring in August dimmed hopes of a strengthening job market. 
  
 some economists think it might differ from the previous bond-buying programs. With its earlier purchases, the Fed announced a dollar amount and a time frame for the bonds it planned to buy. 
  
 any new bond-purchase program might be more open-ended. Three regional Fed bank presidents _ Eric Rosengren of Boston, James Bullard of St. Louis and Charles Evans of Chicago _ have expressed openness to a program in which the Fed would buy bonds until the economy improved significantly and unemployment fell consistently _ as long as inflation remained tame. 
  
 None of those officials now have a vote on the Fed's policy committee. But they take part in the committee discussions that would allow them to push the idea. 
  
 he expects the Fed to announce a more conventional bond-buying program of around $500 billion. That would be less than the $600 billion in bonds in QE2 and well below the $1.75 trillion in QE1. 
  
 Jones doesn't think the Fed wants to delay further support for the economy until the election is over. Neither does Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial. 
  
"" Swonk said. ""They are trying for as much shock and awe as they can muster."" |||||

Detroit DJ Terrence Parker uses his advanced turntablism skills and his focus on precision to blend hip hop music DJing styles, such as rhythmic scratching, in his house mixes. Fellow Detroit spinner DJ Minx is a notable woman house DJ. Her records on her Women on Wax label blend Parker-influenced turntablism precision with a funky style. In the UK, any house song released by a Chicago-based label was routinely considered a ""must-play"" at UK house music clubs. Paradise Garage in New York City was still a top club in the house era, just as it had been during the disco age. The emergence of Todd Terry, a pioneer of the genre, demonstrated the continuum from the underground disco approach which moved to a new house sound. Terry's cover of Class Action's ""Weekend"" (mixed by Larry Levan) shows how Terry drew on newer hip-hop influences, such as the quicker sampling and the more rugged basslines. In the late 1980s, Nu Groove Records launched and nurtured the careers of Rheji Burrell and Rhano Burrell, collectively known as Burrell (after a brief stay on Virgin America via Timmy Regisford and Frank Mendez). Nu Groove also had a stable of other NYC underground scene DJs. The Burrell's created the ""New York Underground"" sound of house, and they did 30+ releases on this label featuring this sound. In the 2010s, Nu Groove Record releases like the Burrells' enjoy a cult status among ""crate diggers"" and DJs. Mint-condition vinyl records by the Burrells from the 1980s can fetch high prices. By the late 1980s, house DJing and production had moved to the US's west coast, particularly to San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles, Fresno, San Diego and Seattle. Los Angeles saw am explosion of underground raves, where DJs mixed dance tracks. L.A. DJs Marques Wyatt and Billy Long spun at Jewel's Catch One. In 1989, the L.A.-based, former EBN-OZN singer/rapper Robert Ozn started indie house label One Voice Records. Ozn released the Mike..., can you guess it ?

Five-for: Graham Swann spins England to victory in second Test Photo: AP

 with two Tests to play.

 fittingly, took the final wicket of Dale Steyn to lead England off the field and, presumably, into an early New Year party.

 and then Fred Titmus and David Allen spun them to victory. And it was only the sixth time South Africa have lost by an innings since their reintroduction to Test cricket.

 Stuart Broad from the Umgeni End, Swann from the Old Fort End. A first wicket was not long in coming.

 Morne Morkel did not last beyond the fifth ball of Swann's opening over, the second of the day, to continue Swann's remarkable record of striking immediately in a spell.

 in fact, have gone to the fourth ball, edging low to slip where Andrew Strauss, rather than the incapacitated Paul Collingwood, failed to take the chance to his right.

 but to the next ball the tall, left-handed Morkel fatally played back. He was struck on the back leg, plumb in front.

 but, had they done so, such a request would have only used up time. There was no doubt about the decision.

 however, and they soon put it to good use. Mark Boucher appeared to glove a short Broad delivery down the leg-side to wicketkeeper Matt Prior. England's appeal was huge and concerted. But umpire Amiesh Saheba did not concur. TV replays showed clearly that the ball had made contact with Boucher's gloves. Off he went for 29: 108-8.

 especially from Swann, but not confident enough for Strauss to make the required T-sign for a review.

Replays showed that the ball pitched in line and would have hit the stumps comfortably. South Africa should have been nine down.

 on 27 and 31, off Swann, the first wide of slip and the second a sharp chance at short mid-wicket.

 with his fourth ball persuading Harris to chip to mid-on where Broad, unable to be kept out of the game, took the catch. He had made 36 from No 9, South Africa's top score of the innings, an embarrassing statistic for a much-vaunted top order. It was 129-9.

It was soon 133 all out. Steyn played all around a turning Swann delivery and Aleem Dar had no hesitation in raising his finger to cue raucous celebrations.

Swann finished with innings figures of 21-3-54-5 and quite brilliant match figures of 56-6-164-9. Broad also finished proudly with 17-3-43-4.

 one of English cricket's great days.

 Malcolm Denzil Marshall (18 April 1958 - 4 November 1999) was a West Indian cricketer. Primarily a fast bowler, Marshall is regarded as one of the finest and fastest pacemen ever to have played Test cricket. His Test bowling average of 20.94 is the best of anyone who has taken 200 or more wickets. He achieved his bowling success despite being, by the standards of other fast bowlers, a short man - he stood at 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m), while most of the great quicks have been well above 6 feet (1.8 m) and many great West Indian fast bowlers, such as Joel Garner, Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh, were 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) or above.

 he did take 37 wickets in all first-class games, and Hampshire saw enough in him to take him on as their overseas player for 1979, remaining with the county until 1993. He was in West Indies' World Cup squad, but did not play a match in the tournament. Hampshire were not doing well at the time, but nevertheless he took 47 first-class wickets, as well as picking up 5-13 against Glamorgan in the John Player League.  Marshall came to prominence in 1980, when in the third Test at Old Trafford he accounted for Mike Gatting, Brian Rose and Peter Willey in short order to spark an England collapse, although the match was eventually drawn despite Marshall taking 7-24. After 1980/81 he was out of the Test side for two years, but an excellent 1982 season when he took 134 wickets at under 16 apiece, including a career-best 8-71 against Worcestershire, saw him recalled and thereafter he remained a fixture until the end of his international career.  In seven successive Test series from 1982/83 to 1985/86 he took 21 or more wickets each time, in the last five of them averaging under 20. His most productive series in this period was the 1983/84 rubber against India, when he claimed 33 wickets as well as averaging 34 with the bat and making his highest Test score of 92 at Kanpur. A few months later he took five in an innings twice at home against Australia. At the peak of his career, he turned down an offer of US$1 million to join a rebel West Indies team on a tour to South Africa, still suffering international sporting isolation due to apartheid."

The result on Wednesday was that India felt very much at home on the first day of a pivotal series for Alastair Cook. Certainly there was no home advantage in Nottingham for England on a low, slow batting paradise of a pitch that was prepared more to ensure that the first Investec Test will last into the weekend rather than produce compelling cricket. Duncan Fletcher never gives much away but the India coach would have been inwardly grinning like a Cheshire cat behind his inscrutable façade at the warm hospitality offered to his side here by his old employers at the ECB.

 another member of the team has created a situation with which the team dealt swiftly and decisively. 
  
 The Dolphins announced that cornerback Don Jones has been fined by the team and excused from offseason workouts “until such time that he undergoes and completes educational training for his recent comments made on social media during the NFL Draft.” 
  
 Jones posted disapproving comments on Twitter after the Rams drafted defensive end Michael Sam — and after ESPN showed an on-air kiss between Sam and another man who wasn’t his twin brother. Jones said “omg” after the kiss was televised, and later called the moment “horrible.” 
  
” Jones said in a statement released by the team. “I take full responsibility for them and I regret that these tweets took away from his draft moment. I remember last year when I was drafted in the seventh round and all of the emotions and happiness I felt when I received the call that gave me an opportunity to play for an NFL team and I wish him all the best in his NFL career. I sincerely apologize to Mr. Ross, my teammates, coaches, staff and fans for these tweets. I am committed to represent the values of the Miami Dolphins organization and appreciate the opportunity I have been given to do so going forward.” 
  
” coach Joe Philbin said. “They were inappropriate and unacceptable, and we regret the negative impact these comments had on such an important weekend for the NFL. We met with Don today about respect, discrimination and judgment. These comments are not consistent with the values and standards of our program. We will continue to emphasize and educate our players that these statements will not be tolerated.” 
  
 it’s tricky to punish a player for views expressed on his own time via his own Twitter page while away from the workplace regarding someone who isn’t even on his team. Plenty of NFL players have made homophobic remarks over the years on Twitter and elsewhere; those comments often are ignored by their teams. Why does the fact that Jones’ remarks — which were far more tame than some of the stuff other NFL players have said about homosexuals — related to a player on another NFL team make them automatically worthy of punishment? 
  
 all players deserve the benefit of clear guidance as to what will trigger adverse action from their employer.

You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps.,"Please answer the following question: Information:  - Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding.  - Roger Eugene Maris (September 10, 1934  December 14, 1985) was an American professional baseball player who played four seasons in the minor leagues and twelve seasons in the major leagues. Maris played right field on four Major League Baseball (MLB) teams, from 1957 through 1968.  - The National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, known simply as the National League (NL), is the older of two leagues constituting Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada, and the world's oldest current professional team sports league. Founded on February 2, 1876, to replace the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, it is sometimes called the Senior Circuit, in contrast to MLB's other league, the American League, which was founded 25 years later. Both leagues currently have 15 teams. The two league champions of 1903 arranged to compete against each other in the inaugural World Series. After the 1904 champions failed to reach a similar agreement, the two leagues formalized the World Series as an arrangement between the leagues. National League teams have won 48 of the 112 World Series contested from 1903 to 2016. The 2016 National League champions are the Chicago Cubs.  - In baseball, a home run (abbreviated HR, also ""homer"", ""dinger"", ""dong"", ""bomb"", ""blast"", ""goner"" , ""shot"", or ""four-bagger"") is scored when the ball is hit in such a way that the batter is able to circle the bases and reach home  safely in one play without any errors being committed by the defensive team in the process. In modern baseball, the feat is typically achieved by hitting the ball over the outfield fence between the foul poles (or making contact with either foul pole) without first touching the ground, resulting in an automatic home run. There is also the ""inside-the-park"" home run, increasingly rare in modern baseball, where the batter reaches home safely while the baseball is in play on the field. When a home run is scored, the batter is also credited with a hit and a run scored, and an RBI for each runner that scores, including himself. Likewise, the pitcher is recorded as having given up a hit, and a run for each runner that scores including the batter.  - The outfield is a sporting term used in cricket and baseball to refer to the area of the field of play further from the batsman or batter than the infield, and in association football to players outside the goal.  - At the end of each Major League Baseball season, the league leaders of various statistical categories are announced. Leading the league in a particular category is referred to as a ""title"".  - The Chicago Cubs are an American professional baseball team based in Chicago, Illinois. The Cubs compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central division, where they are the defending World Series champions. The team plays its home games at Wrigley Field, located on the city's North Side. The Cubs are one of two major league teams in Chicago; the other, the Chicago White Sox, is a member of the American League (AL) Central division. The team, first known as the White Stockings, was a founding member of the NL in 1876, becoming the Chicago Cubs in 1903.  - The Chicago White Sox is an American professional baseball team based in Chicago, Illinois. The White Sox compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) Central division. The White Sox play their home games at Guaranteed Rate Field, located on the city's South Side. They are one of two major league clubs in Chicago; the other is the Chicago Cubs, who are a member of the National League (NL) Central division. The team is currently owned by Jerry Reinsdorf.  - In baseball, the pitcher is the player who throws the baseball from the pitcher's mound toward the catcher to begin each play, with the goal of retiring a batter, who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the pitcher is assigned the number 1. The pitcher is often considered the most important defensive player, and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum. There are many different types of pitchers, such as the starting pitcher, relief pitcher, middle reliever, lefty specialist, setup man, and closer.  - A right fielder, abbreviated RF, is the outfielder in baseball or softball who plays defense in right field. Right field is the area of the outfield to the right of a person standing at home plate and facing towards the pitcher's mound. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the right fielder is assigned the number 9.  - The Oakland Athletics (often abbreviated to A's) are an American professional baseball team based in Oakland, California. The Athletics compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) West division. The club plays its home games at the OaklandAlameda County Coliseum. The club has won nine World Series championships, the third most of all current Major League Baseball teams.  - Mark David McGwire (born October 1, 1963), nicknamed Big Mac, is an American former professional baseball player and currently a bench coach in Major League Baseball (MLB). As a first baseman, his MLB career spanned from 1986 to 2001 while playing for the Oakland Athletics and the St. Louis Cardinals. He quickly grabbed media attention in 1987 as a rookie with the Athletics by hitting 33 home runs before the All-Star break, and would lead the major leagues in home runs that year with 49, setting the single-season rookie record. He appeared in six straight All-Star Games from 1987 to 1992 despite a brief career decline related to injuries. Another string of six consecutive All-Star appearances followed from 1995 to 2001. Each season from 1996 to 1999, he again led the major leagues in home runs.  - Minor leagues are professional sports leagues which are not regarded as the premier leagues in those sports. Minor league teams tend to play in smaller, less elaborate venues, often competing in smaller cities. This term is used in North America with regard to several organizations competing in various sports. They generally have lesser fan bases and smaller budgets.  - Wrigley Field is a baseball park located on the North Side of Chicago, Illinois. It is the home of the Chicago Cubs, one of the city's two Major League Baseball (MLB) franchises. It first opened in 1914 as Weeghman Park for Charles Weeghman's Chicago Whales of the Federal League, which folded after the 1915 baseball season. The Cubs played their first home game at the park in on April 20, 1916, defeating the Cincinnati Reds with a score of 76 in 11 innings. Chewing gum magnate William Wrigley Jr. of the Wrigley Company acquired complete control of the Cubs in 1921. It was named Cubs Park from 1920 to 1926, before being renamed Wrigley Field in 1927.  - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States, and the county seat of Cook County. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the U.S.  - Samuel Kelvin Peralta Sosa ( born November 12 , 1968 ) is a retired Dominican professional baseball right fielder . Sosa played with four Major League Baseball teams over his career , which spanned from 1989 to 2007 . Sosa 's Major League career began with the Texas Rangers in . After three seasons with the Chicago White Sox , Sosa became a member of the Chicago Cubs in 1992 and became one of the league 's best hitters . Sosa hit his 400th home runs in his 1,354th game and his 5,273rd at - bat , the quickest in National League history . In 1998 , Sosa and Mark McGwire achieved national fame for their home run - hitting prowess in pursuit of Roger Maris ' home run record .  - The World Series is the annual championship series of Major League Baseball (MLB) in North America, contested since 1903 between the American League (AL) champion team and the National League (NL) champion team. The winner of the World Series championship is determined through a best-of-seven playoff, and the winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy. As the series is played in October (and occasionally November), during the autumn season in North America, it is often referred to as the Fall Classic.  - Guaranteed Rate Field is a baseball park located in Chicago, Illinois. It serves as the home ballpark for the Chicago White Sox, a Major League Baseball club competing in the American League (AL) Central division. The park is owned by the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, but operated by the White Sox. The park opened for the 1991 season, after the White Sox had spent 81 years at the original Comiskey Park. It also opened with the name Comiskey Park but was renamed U.S. Cellular Field in 2003 after U.S. Cellular bought the naming rights at $68 million over 20 years. The ballpark received its current name on October 31, 2016, after Guaranteed Rate, a private residential mortgage company located in Chicago, purchased the naming rights to the ballpark in a 13-year deal.  - A tournament held in 1933 at the Chicago World's Fair spurred interest in the game. The Amateur Softball Association (ASA) of America (founded 1933) governs the game in the United States and sponsors annual sectional and World Series championships. The World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) regulates rules of play in more than 110 countries, including the United States and Canada; before the WBSC was formed in 2013, the International Softball Federation filled this role. Women's fastpitch softball became a Summer Olympic sport in 1996, but it (and baseball) were dropped from the 2012 Games; they will be reinstated for the 2020 Games.  - The St. Louis Cardinals are an American professional baseball team based in St. Louis, Missouri. The Cardinals compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central division. The new Busch Stadium has been their home ballpark since 2006. With origins as one of the early professional baseball clubs in St. Louis, entrepreneur Chris von der Ahe purchased a barnstorming club in 1881 then known as the Brown Stockings and established them as charter members of the American Association (AA) the following season. Upon the discontinuation of the AA, St. Louis joined the NL in 1892; at that time, they were called the Browns and the Perfectos before they were officially renamed as the Cardinals in 1900.  - Jerry M. Reinsdorf (born February 25, 1936) is a CPA, lawyer and an owner of the NBA's Chicago Bulls and the MLB's Chicago White Sox. He started his professional life as a tax attorney with the Internal Revenue Service. He has been the head of the White Sox and Bulls for over 25 years.  - The American League of Professional Baseball Clubs, or simply the American League (AL), is one of two leagues that make up Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada. It developed from the Western League, a minor league based in the Great Lakes states, which eventually aspired to major league status. It is sometimes called the Junior Circuit because it claimed Major League status for the 1901 season, 25 years after the formation of the National League (the ""Senior Circuit"").    What is the relationship between 'sammy sosa' and 'baseball player'?

 22:03 by T.W. | MEXICO CITY

Our Mexico correspondent will be posting regular dispatches on the country’s presidential campaign from now until the vote on July 1st.

 where in a small, baking-hot room upstairs, about a dozen students were taking turns to pass around a muffled microphone. The event was fairly chaotic but nonetheless attracted journalists from around the world. I counted at least 15 television cameras. Why so much interest?

 or “I am number 132”. The movement emerged after Enrique Peña Nieto, the front-runner in July 1st’s presidential election, was roundly heckled by students on a visit to Mexico City’s Iberoamerican University on May 11th. Spinners from Mr Peña’s Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) suggested that the hecklers were not really students, but partisan imposters. Shortly afterwards, 131 of them posted a YouTube video affirming that they were indeed real students. Twitter was soon abuzz with others declaring that they didn’t much care for Mr Peña either, using the hashtag #yosoy132.

 protesting both against Mr Peña and the favourable coverage that he allegedly receives from Televisa, a broadcaster which accounts for about 70% of Mexico’s free-to-view television audience. Some local newspapers have given the protesters enormous coverage: “Young people awaken”, read the front page of Reforma yesterday; “Youth vote, capable of deciding election”, said the splash in La Jornada.

 social networks are still only modestly influential in Mexico. Students at the private Ibero and other universities are just as plugged in to Facebook and so on as those anywhere else in the world, but the same is not yet true of the population at large. According to Mitofsky, a pollster, just 9% of Mexicans say they form their political views based on the internet, compared with 39% on television and radio and 29% on newspapers.

 although the youth vote is certainly capable of deciding the election in mathematical terms, it seems that young people are among Mr Peña’s strongest backers. Though the marches of Yo Soy 132 have a strong anti-PRI current, it is not representative of the country at large. The same Mitofsky survey shows that Mr Peña’s supporters are in fact slightly younger than those of the other two main candidates: 32% are aged 18 to 29, versus 30% and 29% for his rivals.

 the anti-PRI vote does not seem as strong as it has been in previous elections, when the party’s 71-year hold on power was in the more recent past. The Mitofsky poll finds that the centrist Mr Peña is the second choice both of people who plan to vote for the right-wing National Action Party and of those who support the left-wing Party of the Democratic Revolution. There are certainly a number of anyone-but-Peña voters, particularly in Mexico City, but not enough to tip the scales against him.

 and the student movement could easily gain further momentum. But many of the assumptions being made about the factors underlying its strength look doubtful.

A fast bowler, he took 405 Test wickets at an average of 20.99 and topped the ICC Player Rankings for much of his career to be rated the best bowler in the world. His great height--he is 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) tall--allowed him to make the ball bounce unusually high after he delivered it; allied to his pace and accuracy, it made him a difficult bowler for batsmen to face. A man of few words during his career, he was notoriously reluctant to speak to journalists.

 recovering from losing the second Test to win the final two matches and take the series 2-1. The team also won the annual World Series Cup. In the first three Tests, Ambrose was hampered by pitches which did not suit his bowling and, according to Tony Cozier writing in Wisden, was often unlucky when he bowled, although he took five for 66 in the first Test. In the final two Tests, he took 19 wickets. In the fourth he took ten wickets, including six for 74 in the first innings; in the second innings, he took three wickets in 19 deliveries and the West Indies won the match by one run. According to Cozier, the captains of both teams, Richie Richardson and Allan Border, ""paid tribute to the man who made the result possible: Ambrose consolidated his reputation as the world's leading bowler"". On the first day of the decisive final Test, Ambrose took seven wickets at the cost of one run from 32 deliveries and finished with figures of seven for 25. Cozier described it as ""one of Test cricket's most devastating spells"". West Indies won by an innings and Ambrose was named man of the series, having taken 33 wickets to equal the record in an Australia-West Indies Test series. He topped the West Indian bowling averages with an average of 16.42. Cozier described Ambrose's performance as ""instrumental in winning [the series]"" and his bowling as ""flawless"".  In the one-day tournament, Ambrose took 18 wickets at 13.38. He took eight wickets in the two-match final--both games were won by the West Indies. In the first final, he took five for 32, driven to bowl with more hostility when the Australian batsman Dean Jones asked him to remove his white wristbands while bowling. He followed up with three for 26 in the second match to be named player of the finals. After a one-day tournament in South Africa, West Indies returned home for Test and ODI series against Pakistan. The ODI series was drawn, but the West Indies defeated Pakistan 2-0 in the Tests. Ambrose took nine wickets at 23.11 to be fifth in the team bowling averages. The Wisden report suggested that he was suffering from fatigue after his team's busy schedule, but although not at his best, he continued to take important wickets. For Northamptonshire in 1993, Ambrose was second in the team first-class bowling averages with 59 wickets at 20.45.  Having developed a slower ball, and using the yorker more sparingly, Ambrose took five wickets in three games as West Indies won an ODI tournament in Sharjah in late October and November 1993. The team competed in another tournament, this time in India, later that November. They finished as runners-up, and Ambrose took four wickets in five matches. Immediately following this, West Indies toured Sri Lanka to play three ODIs and a Test, a rain-ruined match in which Ambrose took three wickets.

In the sport of cricket, a hat-trick is an occasion where a bowler takes three wickets in consecutive deliveries. As of 31 July 2017, this feat has only been achieved 43 times in more than two thousand Test matches, the form of the sport in which national representative teams compete in matches of up to five days' duration. The first Test hat-trick was recorded on 2 January 1879, in only the third Test match to take place, by the Australian pace bowler Fred Spofforth, nicknamed ""The Demon Bowler"", who dismissed three English batsmen with consecutive deliveries at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The most recent bowler to achieve the feat was English spin bowler Moeen Ali against South Africa on 31 July 2017. At least one bowler from each of the ten nations that have played Test cricket have taken a Test hat-trick.

It was clear that he intended the letter to be printed in the press, and it appeared in full in The Daily Telegraph on 1 April, among other London newspapers, reigniting the furore. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack considered the incident of such significance that it reprinted the whole correspondence. The letter gives a detailed contemporary account of what Lord Harris thought about the riot.Lord Harris referred to the crowd as a ""howling mob"" and said ""I have seen no reason as yet to change my opinion of Coulthard's qualities, or to regret his engagement, in which opinion I am joined by the whole team"".

Prosecutors, however, say the couple had had a shouting match and Steenkamp fled to the bathroom, and locked herself in. Pistorius, 26, allegedly got up from bed and had to put on his prosthetic legs to reach the toilet door. The door was broken open after the shots were fired, prosecutors charge. 
  
 the so-called Blade Runner, are poking headline-grabbing holes in the forensic evidence arrayed against the South African double amputee, but none of it changes facts that show the Olympic sprinter killed his model girlfriend, said former LAPD investigator and author Mark Fuhrman.

 Fuhrman said the evidence is a much better fit with the explanation that prosecutors have offered.

The railroad no longer exists as a separate entity, but much of its trackage continues to be used by its successor and other roads, and is commemorated in buildings like the historic Milwaukee Road Depot in Minneapolis, Minnesota and in railroad hardware still maintained by railfans, such as the Milwaukee Road 261 steam locomotive.  - Wisconsin Central Ltd. is a railroad subsidiary of the Canadian National Railway. At one time, its parent Wisconsin Central Transportation Corporation owned or operated railroads in the United States, Canada (Algoma Central Railway), the United Kingdom (English Welsh & Scottish), New Zealand (Tranz Rail), and Australia (Australian Transport Network).  - The Soo Line Railroad is the primary United States railroad subsidiary of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP), controlled through the Soo Line Corporation, and one of seven U.S. Class I railroads. Although it is named for the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad (MStP&SSM), which was commonly known as the Soo Line after the phonetic spelling of Sault, it was formed in 1961 by the consolidation of that company with two other CP subsidiaries, the Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railroad and Wisconsin Central Railroad. It is also the successor to other Class I railroads, including the Minneapolis, Northfield and Southern Railway (acquired 1982) and Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road, acquired at bankruptcy in 1985). On the other hand, a large amount of mileage was spun off in 1987 to Wisconsin Central Ltd., now part of the Canadian National Railway. The Soo Line and the Delaware and Hudson Railway, the CP's other major subsidiary (before the 2008 DM&E acquisition), presently do business as the Canadian Pacific Railway, and most equipment has been repainted into the CP's scheme, but the U.S. Surface Transportation Board groups all CP's U.S. subsidiaries under the Soo Line name for reporting purposes.  - Thep Delaware and Hudson Railway is a railroad that operates in the northeastern United States that has been since 1991 owned and operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway under the rail subsidiary Soo Line Corporation also controls the Soo Line Railroad, Canadian Pacific Railway is owned by Canadian Pacific Railway Limited.  - Cisco is a place name for the remnants of a former unincorporated community located along the Soo Line Railroad and US 59 in the NW 1/4 of Section 11 of Badger Township , 149 North , Range 42 West , in Polk County , United States , approximately four miles north of the city of Erskine , and about the same distance south of the city of Brooks . Cisco was still in use as a place name by local people as late as 1990 , but now is but a dim memory among some of the old - timers .  - The Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad was a Class I railroad subsidiary of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the Midwest United States. Commonly known as the Soo Line after the phonetic spelling of Sault, it was merged with several other major CP subsidiaries on January 1, 1961 to form the Soo Line Railroad. As time passes, more and more Soo Line equipment is being repainted into the Canadian Pacific's current paint scheme, slowly erasing the Soo's identity as a subsidiary railroad.  - The Surface Transportation Board (STB) of the United States is a bipartisan, decisionally-independent adjudicatory body organizationally housed within the U.S. Department of Transportation. The STB was established in 1996 to assume some of the regulatory functions that had been administered by the Interstate Commerce Commission when the ICC was abolished. Other ICC regulatory functions were either eliminated or transferred to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration or to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics within DOT.  - The Canadian National Railway Company is a Canadian Class I railway headquartered in Montreal, Quebec that serves Canada and the Midwestern and Southern United States. CN's slogan is """"North America's Railroad"""". CN is a public company with 24,000 employees. It had a market capitalization of 32 billion CAD in 2011. CN was government-owned, having been a Canadian Crown corporation from its founding to its privatization in 1995. Bill Gates was, in 2011, the largest single shareholder of CN stock.  - The Minneapolis, Northfield and Southern Railway was an American short line railroad connecting Minneapolis and Northfield, Minnesota. It was incorporated in 1918 to take over the trackage of the former Minneapolis, St. Paul, Rochester and Dubuque Electric Traction Company, also known as the Dan Patch Lines. On 2 June 1982 it was acquired by the Soo Line Railroad, which operated it as a separate railroad until merging it on January 1, 1986.

 cricket commentator and television personality. He is acknowledged as one of the greatest bowlers of all time. A left-arm fast bowler who could bowl with significant pace, he represented the Pakistan cricket team in Test cricket and One Day International (ODI) matches. In October 2013, Wasim Akram was the only Pakistani cricketer to be named in an all-time Test World XI to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.

 accompanied by seam and swing bowling skills, extended to both inswingers and outswingers. With a very quick bowling action, he could bowl equally well from both sides of the wicket. His mastery of reverse swing with the cricket ball meant he was at his most dangerous towards a bowling innings, and earned him the nickname of one of the ""Sultans of Swing"", the other one being Waqar Younis.  As well as often being able to find the edge of the bat, Akram would also focus his bowling attack on the stumps and had a particularly lethal inswinging yorker. Of his 414 Test wickets, 193 were taken caught, 119 were taken leg before wicket and 102 were bowled. In partnership with Waqar Younis, he intimidated international batsmen in the 1990s. Together Wasim and Waqar, known as ""the two Ws"" of the Pakistani team, were one of the most successful bowling partnerships in cricket.  With the bat he was especially effective against spin bowlers. However, he liked to slog and was criticised for his lack of high scores and giving away his wicket too cheaply. In October 1996 he scored 257 runs not out, of the team's total of 553 against lowly Zimbabwe on a typical flat South Asian pitch at Sheikhupura. He also achieved good scores for the Pakistan team such as his scores of 123 and 45* against Australia to take Pakistan to victory in a low scoring match. His batting was also valuable sometimes to the Pakistan ODI side, such as in the Nehru Cup in 1989, when needing six runs and two balls to win the match, he hit the first delivery he faced, from part-time off-spinner and batting legend, Viv Richards, for a six and secured the cup.  In December 2012 after Ricky Ponting announced his retirement he said that Wasim Akram and Curtly Ambrose were the toughest bowlers he had faced ""Akram for the exact opposite, you could get a few runs off him, but you just knew there was an unplayable ball around the corner, be it with an old ball or with a new ball,"" - Ricky Ponting.

You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.,"Please answer the following question: Information:  - Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding.  - Roger Eugene Maris (September 10, 1934  December 14, 1985) was an American professional baseball player who played four seasons in the minor leagues and twelve seasons in the major leagues. Maris played right field on four Major League Baseball (MLB) teams, from 1957 through 1968.  - The National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, known simply as the National League (NL), is the older of two leagues constituting Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States and Canada, and the world's oldest current professional team sports league. Founded on February 2, 1876, to replace the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, it is sometimes called the Senior Circuit, in contrast to MLB's other league, the American League, which was founded 25 years later. Both leagues currently have 15 teams. The two league champions of 1903 arranged to compete against each other in the inaugural World Series. After the 1904 champions failed to reach a similar agreement, the two leagues formalized the World Series as an arrangement between the leagues. National League teams have won 48 of the 112 World Series contested from 1903 to 2016. The 2016 National League champions are the Chicago Cubs.  - In baseball, a home run (abbreviated HR, also ""homer"", ""dinger"", ""dong"", ""bomb"", ""blast"", ""goner"" , ""shot"", or ""four-bagger"") is scored when the ball is hit in such a way that the batter is able to circle the bases and reach home  safely in one play without any errors being committed by the defensive team in the process. In modern baseball, the feat is typically achieved by hitting the ball over the outfield fence between the foul poles (or making contact with either foul pole) without first touching the ground, resulting in an automatic home run. There is also the ""inside-the-park"" home run, increasingly rare in modern baseball, where the batter reaches home safely while the baseball is in play on the field. When a home run is scored, the batter is also credited with a hit and a run scored, and an RBI for each runner that scores, including himself. Likewise, the pitcher is recorded as having given up a hit, and a run for each runner that scores including the batter.  - The outfield is a sporting term used in cricket and baseball to refer to the area of the field of play further from the batsman or batter than the infield, and in association football to players outside the goal.  - At the end of each Major League Baseball season, the league leaders of various statistical categories are announced. Leading the league in a particular category is referred to as a ""title"".  - The Chicago Cubs are an American professional baseball team based in Chicago, Illinois. The Cubs compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central division, where they are the defending World Series champions. The team plays its home games at Wrigley Field, located on the city's North Side. The Cubs are one of two major league teams in Chicago; the other, the Chicago White Sox, is a member of the American League (AL) Central division. The team, first known as the White Stockings, was a founding member of the NL in 1876, becoming the Chicago Cubs in 1903.  - The Chicago White Sox is an American professional baseball team based in Chicago, Illinois. The White Sox compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) Central division. The White Sox play their home games at Guaranteed Rate Field, located on the city's South Side. They are one of two major league clubs in Chicago; the other is the Chicago Cubs, who are a member of the National League (NL) Central division. The team is currently owned by Jerry Reinsdorf.  - In baseball, the pitcher is the player who throws the baseball from the pitcher's mound toward the catcher to begin each play, with the goal of retiring a batter, who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the pitcher is assigned the number 1. The pitcher is often considered the most important defensive player, and as such is situated at the right end of the defensive spectrum. There are many different types of pitchers, such as the starting pitcher, relief pitcher, middle reliever, lefty specialist, setup man, and closer.  - A right fielder, abbreviated RF, is the outfielder in baseball or softball who plays defense in right field. Right field is the area of the outfield to the right of a person standing at home plate and facing towards the pitcher's mound. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the right fielder is assigned the number 9.  - The Oakland Athletics (often abbreviated to A's) are an American professional baseball team based in Oakland, California. The Athletics compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) West division. The club plays its home games at the OaklandAlameda County Coliseum. The club has won nine World Series championships, the third most of all current Major League Baseball teams.  - Mark David McGwire (born October 1, 1963), nicknamed Big Mac, is an American former professional baseball player and currently a bench coach in Major League Baseball (MLB). As a first baseman, his MLB career spanned from 1986 to 2001 while playing for the Oakland Athletics and the St. Louis Cardinals. He quickly grabbed media attention in 1987 as a rookie with the Athletics by hitting 33 home runs before the All-Star break, and would lead the major leagues in home runs that year with 49, setting the single-season rookie record. He appeared in six straight All-Star Games from 1987 to 1992 despite a brief career decline related to injuries. Another string of six consecutive All-Star appearances followed from 1995 to 2001. Each season from 1996 to 1999, he again led the major leagues in home runs.  - Minor leagues are professional sports leagues which are not regarded as the premier leagues in those sports. Minor league teams tend to play in smaller, less elaborate venues, often competing in smaller cities.

It serves as the home ballpark for the Chicago White Sox, a Major League Baseball club competing in the American League (AL) Central division. The park is owned by the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, but operated by the White Sox. The park opened for the 1991 season, after the White Sox had spent 81 years at the original Comiskey Park.

They continually suck up to him and try to outdo each other in order to inherit his millions when he passes away. With their attempts constantly failing and irritable Uncle Joe showing a decided interest in his new sexy ""nurse"" Molly (d'Abo), Frank decides to hire a private detective named Laura (Khandi Alexander) to bring in his brother Daniel (who turned his back on the family years ago because of their money driven ways) believing if they can make up, Uncle Joe will thaw towards them. Instead of finding Daniel, Laura finds his son Danny (Fox) of whom Uncle Joe had always been especially fond when he was a little boy. Professional bowler Danny left the family with his father, but he accepts the cousins' invitation to return â after rolling a gutter ball in a big tournament and finding out that he has a pre-arthritic condition developing in his wrist. Danny's television sports producer girlfriend Robin (Travis) encourages him to ask Uncle Joe for a loan to invest in a bowling alley. A typically rude and crude Joe says he will lend the money only if Danny sides with him against his own father. Danny is offended and leaves with his girlfriend, much to the annoyance of the other relatives. They confront Molly later on and she realizes just how conniving and desperate they are for Uncle Joe's money. Uncle Joe asks Danny to visit him at his scrapyard, to apologize for trying to bribe him with money, but the old man calls a number to place a shipping order to a company he finds out has been closed for 25 years. Realizing that his relatives could declare him incompetent and throw him in a retirement home, he tells Danny that he plans to hand his fortune over to Molly.

He is not necessarily talking about where he pitches the off-breaks that made him a valuable contributor in last summer’s T20, or the weight of his new bat. The 32-year-old is just as likely to be explaining his analysis of an afternoon’s runners. A new three-year deal has just been signed with his county but Smith is planning for a longer-term future which he hopes will be played out on a different form of turf. Hampshire cricket all-rounder Will Smith says he has been hooked on racing since he was five-years-old. Smith said he would like to go into racing punditry when he finishes playing cricket in six or seven years time. Racing fan Smith (left) talks to Sportsmail's Marcus Townend (right) at Kempton. 1 VAUTOUR: Quite simply, wins the Arkle Chase at the Cheltenham Festival by 10 lengths! 2 FAUGHEEN: Wins the Champion Hurdle by five lengths! 3 BRIAR HILL: Fell in last season’s Albert Bartlett Hurdle but had previously beaten first and third Very Wood and Apache Jack at Naas, giving them weight. 4 CAPOTE: Soft ground staying chaser who should prove better than his hurdling form. 5 ELENIKA: Very well handicapped for steeplechasing and goes well fresh. 6 CHAMPAGNE AT TARA: Will prove better upped in trip and nicely handicapped. 7 OUR JOEY: Highly rated by Cumbrian trainer George Bewley. Soft ground will suit him well. 8 MANY CLOUDS: Can win a high-class handicap chase between 2m4f-3m. 9 GOLDEN CHIEFTAIN: Ran well on reappearance at Cheltenham. Runs in Badger Beer Chase at Wincanton this afternoon. 10 SHUTTHEFRONTDOOR: Looks suited to the Grand National. On Wednesday he was the studio expert for subscription channel Racing UK, interpreting the action from Nottingham and Warwick. During the winter months, Smith can also be found offering useful advice to punters via William Hill radio. Smith has scored more than 7,000 first-class runs, won four County Championship medals (three with Durham and one with Nottinghamshire) and was a member of the Hampshire team which won this year’s Division Two to gain promotion. But he has an equal passion for horseracing. He said: ‘My father used to take me and my older brother to Towcester every Boxing Day and Easter Monday. I loved everything about a racecourse, the atmosphere, the smells. I was five or six and it got me hooked. ‘Throughout my teenage years I always studied the form in the hope of making a pound or two. I have always had an analytical mind so I enjoyed that side of it. ‘Two winters ago, I was coming into the last year of my contract with Durham. It was up in the air whether I would get another deal because of their financial troubles. ‘I thought I might have to do something else so I thought “what do I have a passion for?”’ The cricketer, who captained Durham as they retained their title in the 2009 season, said: ‘I pestered the (RUK) producer with emails and didn’t let him have a moment’s peace because I was so keen. I love doing the punditry. It is ideally where I would like to be once the cricket finishes even if, hopefully, that is another six or seven years down the line.’ Smith revealed that in 2009 he was unsure whether he would get a new Durham contract so was f. Smith has scored more than 7,000 first-class runs and has won four County Championship medals. Smith captained current England skipper Alastair Cook when the two were at Bedford School together. Smith, who took three for 15 when a losing semi-finalist in the T20 finals in August, has a cricket pedigree as rich as some of the racehorses he analyses. His fielding skills earned him a stint as a substitute fielder for England while on the Notts staff and, prior to playing for British Universities, he captained current England skipper Alastair Cook while they were contemporaries at Bedford School. Smith said: ‘He was 4ft 2in and I don’t think his voice had broken but you could tell he had a bit of talent. I was No 3 and Alastair opened with James Stedman, who went on to play hockey for England. ‘They put on numerous double hundred partnerships so I spent a lot of my time with my pads on not doing a lot.’ Smith, married to Catherine with two daughters, Ava, three, and Daisy, six months, believes his interest in racing acts as a useful diversion from the demands of the county circuit. He said: ‘If you are just watching the cricket you become a little too intense about it, or I do anyway. Also at night time you just want to switch off. ‘I go out for a meal with team-mates and then can sit back and watch the racing I have missed and catch up on the form.’ Another result at Hampshire suggests Smith has not given his team-mates too many losing tips — he was voted Players’ Player of the Year for 2014.

 she can't read and she not really anybody to look at but she is a flirt. It is obvious the male customers in that coffee shop are there because of her. One day Phillip a club footed failed painter medical student comes in the shop to say a good word for his friend but he becomes besotted the moment he sees her. He starts buying her things even pays for her apartment. Meanwhile she is seeing other people and she makes no secrets of it. He dreams about her like she is a angel, but she is no angel. He is constantly thinking about her. His med school grades are even failing. So what the nookie is too good. He wants to marry her but she rejects him because she is marrying another guy. She always lets Phil know she really doesn't have love feelings for him all of time. He is heart broken but he meets another woman. They seem fine but it is obvious he is still dreaming of the Bimbo. Mildred does comes back with a baby and unwed. Phillip takes her in again, but she starts going out with a friend of his, the light bulb comes on a little and he kicks her out. She does what she knows works so she tries to seduce him, well it doesn't work and she proceeds to burn his tuition money up. Oh we have a club foot that he has problems about, even though a street teenager who has the same problem tells him to lighten up about it. He meets another girl named Sally we have a March of time montage which shows her aging while he strings her along still waiting for Mildred. Well he has no school tuition, can't find a job. Finally Sally and her dad takes him in. Not before another March of Time montage showing him going downhill. Soon his uncle who raised him dies and he gets money to become a doctor. Meanwhile he finds Mildred needs him again. She has TB. meanwhile he is still leading Sally down the Primrose path about marriage and he takes a job on a steamship. Finally the bimbo dies and Phillip declares he is free now and he will marry Sally. I wished she told him to stuff it. Now I know my take on the characters are not going to get me any points. But I feel Phillip was the bad guy. Yes Mildred is a Strumpet BUT he knows it, and he keeps coming back. Mean while he has two other girlfriends who love him but he treats as appetizers. I guess the sex wasn't as good. But in any case he dogs those women waiting for Mildred. Not only that but the man who gets Mildred pregnant is already married and when Philip asks him what he intends to do about Baby ( apparently the baby's name) he laughs is off, he has no intention in supporting her and Baby and he is wealthy. Sally's father who has 9 children say some pretty nasty things about women but he is said to be a old traditionalist. Philip doesn't seem to refute his feelings either. Men are using Mildred as a Boy Toy but the men in this movie come out as unscathed. Yes she was not a respectable woman but far from a villain. To me it is Philip who was had the real problem and it was his sexual obsession for Mildred."

Movie title: Meet the Robinsons Movie plot: Lewis is an aspiring 12-year-old inventor at an orphanage whose inventions have been scaring off potential parents. He decides that his mother, who abandoned him at the orphanage as an infant, is the only one who ever truly loved him and works on a machine to scan his memory to locate her. Taking his memory scanner to his school's science fair, Lewis meets 13-year-old Wilbur Robinson, a mysterious boy claiming to be a time cop from the future. Wilbur needs to recover a time machine that a man wearing a bowler hat has stolen. Lewis tries to demonstrate the scanner, but it falls apart, throwing the science fair into chaos. Upset, Lewis leaves while the Bowler Hat Guy, with the help of a robotic bowler hat named Doris, repairs and steals the scanner. Wilbur meets Lewis at the orphanage and asks him to repair the scanner. Lewis agrees to do so only if Wilbur can prove he is telling the truth, which Wilbur does by taking them to the year 2037 in a second time machine. When they arrive, however, Lewis says he can use the time machine instead of the scanner, and he and Wilbur get into an argument and crash. Wilbur then asks Lewis to fix the time machine, but Lewis has another condition: Wilbur has to take him to visit his mother afterwards. Reluctantly, Wilbur agrees and hides Lewis in the garage. Lewis doesn't stay there for long, however, and ends up meeting the rest of the Robinsons except for Cornelius, Wilbur's father, who is away on a business trip. Following Lewis, the Bowler Hat Guy and Doris unsuccessfully try to kidnap him. Meanwhile, the Robinsons offer to adopt Lewis, but change their mind when they learn that he's from the past. Wilbur admits to lying to Lewis about taking him back to see his mom, causing Lewis to run off in disgust.

 {'1': "", '2': "", '3': "", '4': ""} ( ; 12 February 1809 – 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist, geologist and biologist, best known for his contributions to the science of evolution. He established that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors and, in a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding.

He was Test opening batsman from 1988 to 1999, as well as captain from 1994 to 1999, succeeding Allan Border. His predominant fielding position was first slip. He was widely regarded as an instrumental component in Australia's rise to Test cricket dominance, and his captaincy was regarded as adventurous and highly effective.
 and his wife Judy, Mark Taylor's early years were spent at Wagga Wagga, where his family relocated when he was eight. His father had a sporting background, playing first grade rugby in Newcastle. The young Taylor preferred Australian rules football and cricket. He learned to bat in the family garage, with his father throwing cork balls to him. Taylor idolised Arthur Morris, the left-handed opening batsmen from New South Wales who led the aggregates on the 1948 ""Invincibles"" tour of England.  Taylor played for his primary school as an opening batsman, and made his first century at the age of thirteen for the Lake Albert club at Bolton Park in Wagga. His family then moved to the north shore of Sydney, where he joined Northern District in Sydney Grade Cricket. Completing his secondary education at Chatswood High School, he later obtained a degree in surveying at the University of New South Wales. Along with the Waugh twins, Steve and Mark, Taylor played in under-19 youth internationals for Australia against Sri Lanka in 1982-83.  Taylor made his Sheffield Shield debut in 1985-86 when NSW was depleted by the defection of regular openers Steve Smith and John Dyson to a rebel tour of South Africa. Opening with fellow debutant Mark Waugh, he scored 12 and 56 not out against Tasmania. His first season was highlighted by home and away centuries against South Australia in a total of 937 runs at 49.31 average. He had a lean season in 1987-88, after which he spent the English summer with Greenmount, helping them to win their first Bolton League title by scoring more than 1,300 runs at an average of 70.  He originally trained as a surveyor, and received a degree in surveying from the University of New South Wales in 1987.

He is the fastest bowler ever in the history of cricket, who delivered the fastest delivery officially recorded at a top speed of 161.3 km/h in a pool match against England in the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Akhtar was nicknamed as ""Rawalpindi Express"" & ""Tiger"", as a tribute to his hometown and fast bowling. He is the first bowler to break the 100 mph barrier as well, which he did twice in his career.

 PCB named him in a list of 35 probables for the Asia Cup. On 15 June 2010, Akhtar made his return, taking 3 wickets for 28 runs in the first match of the Asia Cup against Sri Lanka. He narrowly missed out a spot in the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 in place of the injured Umar Gul.  In July 2010, he was selected for the Twenty20 series against Australia but the selectors decided not to play him in the Test squad so that he would not get injured. He was subsequently selected for the ODI and Twenty20 series against England in September 2010.  Akhtar returned to the national side representing the country against England in the Twenty20 International. He bowled an impressive spell and returned with figures of 2 wickets for 23 runs. He continued to bowl well in the ODI series in the absence of regular fast-bowlers, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir, who were suspended by the International Cricket Council amid allegations of Spot-fixing. Despite his relatively good bowling form, Pakistani coach Waqar Younis insisted that the bowling attack must not become reliant on Akhtar, as he is 35 years of age and fitness troubles continue to affect him. Akhtar was selected for the tour of New Zealand and started his campaign off well with 3 wickets on Boxing Day in the first of two Twenty20 Internationals against New Zealand.  Akhtar was selected in Pakistan's 15-man squad to play in the 2011 World Cup hosted by Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka in February to March. During the tournament, he announced that he would retire from international cricket at the end of the World Cup. He was dropped from the squad after group matches and was not included in the quarter final either. In September, Akhtar released his autobiography, Controversially Yours.

The submarine crew finds refuge in Melbourne, Australia, which the radioactive fallout has not yet reached (though radio communications with several radio operators farther north than Australia indicate that radiation has reached their countries and will be in Australia in a few months). Towers places his vessel under the command of the Royal Australian Navy and is summoned to attend a briefing. When Towers (Armand Assante), Australian scientist Julian Osborne (Bryan Brown) and Australian liaison officer Peter Holmes (Grant Bowler) find out there is an automated digital broadcast coming from Alaska in the Northern Hemisphere, the submarine is sent to investigate. En route, the submarine surfaces in San Francisco, where the Golden Gate Bridge has collapsed and the city shoreline is in ruins. A crew member who is from San Francisco abandons ship, planning on dying in his home city, and is left by his shipmates after it is argued that the length of time he has spent outside has already made him sick with radiation sickness.

Instead he had to carry an indictment by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for allegedly committing crimes against humanity after the previous elections, in 2007.
 to his delight, his case has now collapsed. Kenya's campaign to have the charges dropped won the day - with the ICC prosecutor admitting she did not have enough evidence.
 and running mate William Ruto, who is still facing ICC charges, galvanised support by accusing the court of meddling in domestic affairs.
 the impact of their campaign was instant and far-reaching.
 which often degenerated into violent clashes, was pushed aside as they catapulted into leadership.
But now the relationship between Mr Kenyatta and his deputy could be seriously tested as Mr Ruto's trial at The Hague is ongoing.
They may remain personal friends - but the reaction within their own political and ethnic groupings could be different.
 Mr Kenyatta always shied away from politics, wanting to be seen as an ordinary person at ease with ordinary Kenyans.
 he went to one of the best schools in Nairobi before attending Amherst College in the US where he studied Political Science and Economics.
Mr Kenyatta does not have a natural flair for public speaking but has a powerful voice and can be persuasive when fighting his corner.
 which helps him to connect with his countrymen in rural areas.
 which means ""young man"" - and he made history last year by being sworn in as Kenya's youngest president.
 together with four other sons of prominent politicians, he issued a statement urging the then-ruling party, Kenya African National Union (Kanu), to open up the political space.
Many in Kenya thought such a move would draw the wrath of then-President Daniel arap Moi.
 the leader brought young Kenyatta closer and guided him into politics.
Uhuru Kenyatta in focus:
The most prominent stage in Mr Kenyatta's political career under the tutelage of Mr Moi came in 2002 when the outgoing president anointed him as his successor on a Kanu ticket.
The decision saw a number of key members of Kanu such as Raila Odinga and then Vice-President George Saitoti walk out of the party and away from Mr Moi's ""Uhuru Project"".
 who benefitted from Mr Odinga's support.
During the 2007 elections Mr Kenyatta supported President Kibaki's bid for a second term against Mr Odinga.
000 people died and some 600,000 people were displaced - forced Mr Kibaki and Mr Odinga to form a coalition government.
Mr Kenyatta became one of the two deputy prime ministers and also minister of trade. He was later appointed to the treasury as minister for finance.
 assistant ministers and permanent secretaries return their official Mercedes Benz cars in exchange for the more economical Volkswagen Passats.
Mr Kenyatta has been keen to demonstrate that he is his own man. He is no longer Moi's ""project"" and does not need political patronage from Mr Kibaki either.
 The National Alliance (TNA), and has gone on to form a coalition with other parties that backing his 2013 presidential bid.
 in tune with the country's youth and tech-savvy.
While preparing the 2011/12 budget he used Twitter to invite public contributions.
Since taking office he has been keen to show that he has a ""digital administration"" capable of developing Kenya.
He has set up an anti-corruption website for people to report concerns directly to him and launched e-centres - ""one-stop shop"" to access and pay for government services electronically in order to cut corruption and bureaucracy.
He is ranked by Forbes Magazine as the 26th richest person in Africa with an estimated fortune of $500m (Â£318m).
 the Kenyatta family owns TV channel K24, The People newspaper and a number of radio stations.
 banking, construction, dairy and insurance sectors.
 central and coastal regions of Kenya.
It is the land question that haunts Mr Kenyatta and the rest of his family wherever they go in Kenya.
 he was asked how much land his family owned.
He replied: ""I don't need to answer that question because that's not the issue. Land reform is not about a person; land reform is about a nation. It's not that I won't tell you. It's that I don't need to tell you.""
Land is the source of nearly all ethnic clashes that bedevil the Rift Valley. It is so divisive that during the last election the inspector general of police told political candidates not to make it a campaign issue.
 Mr Kenyatta acknowledged that ""Kenya's future prosperity is dependent upon the transformation into a property owning and land-user rights democracy.
 so that all Kenyans who want to own their own homes are able to do so.""
 Mr Kenyatta's greatest burden as president has been the terror attacks the country is facing from Islamist militants in neighbouring Somalia.
 they went on a shooting spree in Nairobi's Westgate shopping centre for four days, leaving 67 people dead and more than 200 wounded.
People feel President Kenyatta has not done enough to tackle the problem of insecurity that has brought the country's tourism sector close to its knees and threatens East Africa's largest economy.
 a move that many argue should have been taken a year ago following the Westgate, came after two deadly attacks near the Kenyan-Somali border town of Mandera.
The militant group al-Shabab claimed responsibility and vowed to continue with the attacks until Kenya removed its troops from Somalia.
 Kenyans expect their president to fully focus on the country's security, economy and unemployment.
 the ICC will still occupy some of his time - supporters of Deputy President Ruto will be keen to see that he works as hard to get charges dropped in this case.
Out of six Kenyans indicted the court only two now remain in the dock and prosecutor Fatou Bensouda seems determined not to end up empty handed.
The ICC could still present a serious personal and national challenge for him.

Roy's innings helped England on their way to posting 376 for nine as they claimed a 2-0 one-day series lead. Vince fell agonisingly short of his second century of the tour six overs later, adjudged lbw for 99 from 95 balls, and although wickets tumbled late in the innings, Jonny Bairstow and Ben Stokes maintained the momentum for an imposing total of 376 for nine. There seemed a real danger that would not be enough as Hendricks and Dean Elgar responded with an opening stand of 142 inside 18 overs under the Diamond Oval floodlights. It was Lancashire left-arm spinner Stephen Parry, making his first appearance of the tour, who dragged the Lions back into the match with a tidy spell which earned him the wickets of Elgar, for 66 from 59 balls, and Dane Vilas. Liam Plunkett then claimed one wicket and Mark Wood a couple, but it was Stokes who finally removed Hendricks, driving to cover in the 37th over after making 141, the same score as Roy, from four balls fewer with 14 fours and five sixes. Alex Less readies himself to hit the ball during the match in Kimberley on Wednesday. Harry Gurney also took two wickets before Plunkett returned to claim the last two and end with three for 73 as South Africa A were dismissed for 306 in the 45th over, but Parry remained comfortably the most economical bowler. The Lions now have the first of three chances to clinch the series in Potchefstroom on Saturday, when South Africa's World Cup wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock is expected to boost the home team as he looks for match practice after an ankle injury. Tim Bresnan could come into contention for the Lions, as the Yorkshire all-rounder flew into Johannesburg on Wednesday, and Sam Billings hopes to recover from the nasty illness which ruled him out in Kimberley. Roy plays an expansive shot (left) and he salutes the crowd after reaching his half-century.

Detroit DJ Terrence Parker uses his advanced turntablism skills and his focus on precision to blend hip hop music DJing styles, such as rhythmic scratching, in his house mixes. Fellow Detroit spinner DJ Minx is a notable woman house DJ. Her records on her Women on Wax label blend Parker-influenced turntablism precision with a funky style. In the UK, any house song released by a Chicago-based label was routinely considered a ""must-play"" at UK house music clubs. Paradise Garage in New York City was still a top club in the house era, just as it had been during the disco age. The emergence of Todd Terry, a pioneer of the genre, demonstrated the continuum from the underground disco approach which moved to a new house sound. Terry's cover of Class Action's ""Weekend"" (mixed by Larry Levan) shows how Terry drew on newer hip-hop influences, such as the quicker sampling and the more rugged basslines. In the late 1980s, Nu Groove Records launched and nurtured the careers of Rheji Burrell and Rhano Burrell, collectively known as Burrell (after a brief stay on Virgin America via Timmy Regisford and Frank Mendez). Nu Groove also had a stable of other NYC underground scene DJs. The Burrell's created the ""New York Underground"" sound of house, and they did 30+ releases on this label featuring this sound. In the 2010s, Nu Groove Record releases like the Burrells' enjoy a cult status among ""crate diggers"" and DJs. Mint-condition vinyl records by the Burrells from the 1980s can fetch high prices. By the late 1980s, house DJing and production had moved to the US's west coast, particularly to San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles, Fresno, San Diego and Seattle. Los Angeles saw am explosion of underground raves, where DJs mixed dance tracks. L.A. DJs Marques Wyatt and Billy Long spun at Jewel's Catch One.
